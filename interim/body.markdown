Cerebral blood flow is regulated at arterial pressure of 65­140 mm Hg. Noradrenergic discharge
helps to regulate pressure between 65­200 mm Hg (plateau phase is extended to right). Vasodilator
hydralazine and ACE inhibitor captopril reduce the length of the plateau. (Ganong 610)
Transection of brain stem at the superior border of the pons is called decerebration. The spasticity
is due to increase in the gamma efferent nerves and increase in general excitability of motor neuron
pool. Righting reflexes are integrated at the level of midbrain and will be consequently absent in a
decerebrate preparation. (Ganong 216)
Blood sugar is maintained at a steady level almost to the end. It is formed from liver from amino

pleural, peritoneal, synovial, intraocular (aqueous and vitreous humors) and pericardial fluids,
bile and luminal fluid of the gut, thyroid and cochlea. Transcellular fluid volume is relatively small,
about 1L=15 ml/kg of body weight or 1.5% of body weight. (AK Jain 389)
Amino acid neurotransmitters are excitatory neurotransmitters, e.g. excitatory amino acids, e.g.
glutamic acid, aspartic acid and inhibitory amino acids, e.g. GABA (Gamma­aminobutyric acid),
glycine are inhibitory in cerebellum and spinal cord. (AK Jain 1076)
Ischemia susceptible neurons are B fibres (Erlanger and Gasser’s classification) which are
“preganglionic” autonomic nerve fibers. The least sensitive to hypoxia is C fibers or dorsal root
peripheral nerves that carry pain, touch, temperature and conduct impulses generated by
cutaneous nerves. Even the brain stem can withstand hypoxia for ten minutes whereas other parts
of the brain can resist it for only ten seconds. (AK Jain 149, 150)
The 12 nerve is hypoglossal and is purely motor in nature and innervate muscles of the tongue.
Another purely motor nerve is spinal accessory nerve. 7,9, 10 are mixed nerves. (AK Jain 873)
Isometric means same measure or length. An isometric contraction occurs when the ends of the
muscle do not move during contraction, i.e. muscle contracts, but length of the muscle remains
the same. The tension or force that develops is considerable and can be measured by a force
transducer. An example of isometric contraction is contraction of arm muscles trying to push a
wall. (AK Jain)
The synapse between two efferent neurons lies outside the CNS in a cell cluster called autonomic
ganglia. The nerve fibers passing between the CNS and the ganglia are called preganglionic and
from the ganglionic cells to the periphery are postganglionic fibers. The neurotransmitter released
between pre and post­ganglionic fibers is acetylcholine, whereas it varies between postganglionic
and effector depending on the effector. (AK Jain 947)
Cerebral blood flow is regulated at arterial pressure of 65 ­140 mm Hg. Noradrenergic discharge
helps to regulate pressure between 65 ­200 mm Hg (plateau phase is extended to right). Vasodilator
hydralazine and ACE inhibitor captopril reduce the length of the plateau. (Ganong 610)
Cerebral blood flow is 750 ml/min or 50 ­ 60 ml/min/100 gm. Critical flow level is approximately 18
ml/min/100 gm as flow less than this produces unconsciousness. (AK Jain 384,385)
Oligodendocytes are involved in myelin formation in CNS. Microglia are scavenger cells resembling
tissue macrophages. Astrocytes are of two types. Fibrous are seen in white matter, protoplasmic
with granular cytoplasm are found in gray matter. They form the blood brain barrier. (Ganong 63)
The flocculonodular lobe is functionally related to the vestibular apparatus and therefore called
the vestibulocerebellum. It is concerned with control of body posture and equilibrium.
(AK Jain 990)
Axon originates from a somewhat thickened area of the cell body called Axon Hillock. It is here
where propagated action potentials are generated. (AK Jain 140)
Prefrontal lobe lesion results in flight of ideas, difficulty in planning, distractibility. The other
features include euphoria, a sense of well being, indifference to the environment, loss of recent
memory, loss of attention and restlessness, emotional instability. These are due to loss of
connections between frontal lobe and thalamus and the other cortical association fibers.
(AK Jain 1054)
The area in the upper pons, in the medial parabrachial nucleus, contan both I and E neurons,
called pneumotaxic centre. These are active in both phases of inspiration and expiration and
modify the rhythmic discharge of the medullary respiratory centre. A new concept of pace maker
neurons called Pre Botzinger complex is present. The chloride channels are responsible for the
rhythmicity of respiration, it is believed. (AK Jain 467,468)
Striated muscle contains alternating bands of dark highly refractile Anisotropic a band and light

Complete transaction of the spinal cord leads to flaccid paralysis. During the recovery stage after
about two or three weeks, there occurs paralysis of the upper motor neuron type, characterized by
hypertonia, brisk hyperactive reflexes and positive Babinski’s sign. (AK Jain 959)
Nerve impulses can travel only orthodromically at synapse as acetylcholine vesicles are present
only in the presynaptic terminal. (AK Jain 148)
The tracts in the dorsal (posterior column) include fasciculus gracilis and fasciculus cuneatus.
The lateral white columns lie between the anterior and posterior roots. The tracts include lateral
spinothalamic tract, dorsal (posterior) spinocerebellar and ventral (anterior) spinocerebellar
tract. The tract in ventral (anterior) white column are ventral (anterior) spinothalamic tract. These
are ascending tracts. The descending motor tracts are rubrospinal, tectospinal, reticulospinal,
vestibulospinal tracts. The vestibulospinal is an uncrossed tract that descend throughout the
spinal cord, originating in the lateral vestibular nuclei. It has facilitatory control on the reflex
activity of spinal stretch reflex and helps control tone in antigravity muscles to maintain posture
and equilibrium. (AK Jain 913)
Red muscle fibers are slow muscle fibers as they are innervated by small, slow conducting motor
neuron. These muscles respond slowly and are adapted for long, slow posture maintaining
contractions, e.g. long muscles of limb and muscles of the back. These have moderate glycogen
stores and low ATPase activity. (AK Jain 174,175)
Ponto cerebellar convey motor impulses from motor cortex via pontine nuclei to cerebellum via
middle cerebellar peduncle. The cerebellum is attached to the cerebral cortex like a three pin plug:
superior, inferior and middle peduncles. Olivocerebellar tract conveys information for learning
new movements. (AK Jain 993)
Separate receptors exist for the somatic sensations (touch, pressure, pain and temperature).
Combination of these sensations produce an entirely different experience of new sensations called
synthetic senses. These are itch, vibration sense, two point discrimination. (AK Jain 931)
Golgi tendon organ are found at the musculotendon junction in series with muscle fibers. Ib
efferent from golgi tendon organ arises to synapse at inhibitory neurons in spinal cord. They help
in regulating the inverse stretch reflex. 1a fiber is the afferent from muscle spindle. (AK Jain 905)
The motor homunculus shows representation of the body as upside down. Trunk, then arm, then
thumb and face. The latter have maximum representation. (AK Jain 934)
CSF is produced by choroids plexus and ventricular walls and blood vessels. 550 ml per day is the
production. Flow from III to IV is via cerebral aqueduct. (AK Jain 389-93)
Area 6 is premotor area. Area 4 is primary motor area. Ischemia in Brodman’s area 4 leads to
monoplegia (paralysis of one limb). (AK Jain 940)
Uterine contraction under the influence of oxytocin helps in expulsion of the baby from the uterus.
Platelet plugging is another example of positive feedback homeostasis that prevents further
bleeding. An example of positive feedback that may even lead to death occurs during haemorrhage.

Intrafusal fibers are of two types: nuclear bag fibers, nuclear chain fibers. NBG contain many
nuclei in a dilated central area, nuclear chain fibers have a single chain of nuclei lying in a chain.
Intrafusal muscle fibers contain 2­13 muscle fibers enclosed in a connective tissue capsule.

Thalamus is a great sensory relay station and integrating centre before relaying it to the
cerebral cortex. They relay somesthetic sensations coming from opposite of the body, i.e. pain,
proprioception, temperature. They also form a relay of auditory and visual impulses, impulses
from reticular formation. All other sensations (general or special) pass through the thalamus and
projected to the neocortex, whereas the smell pathways have no relay in the thalamus and there is
no neocortical projection area for olfaction. (AK Jain 1009)
Endolymph is formed by stria vascularis and has an electrolyte concentration similar to ICF. It is
present in the scala media. (AK Jain 967, 1113)
Corticospinal tract arise from the motor cortex in the precentral gyrus. The lateral corticospinal
tract controls lateral muscles or fine manibulatory movement and medial or anterior corticospinal
tract control posture equilibrium and tone (memorise as PET). (AK Jain 936)
Myotonia is a condition characterized by difficulty and slowness in relaxing muscle after voluntary
effort. This is due to abnormalities on genes 7,17 or 19 chromosomes, which result in abnormalities
of Na+ or Cl– channels. (AK Jain 177)
Calcium is required for exocytosis of acetylcholine from presynaptic neuron to the synaptic cleft.
Muscle weakness is caused by antibodies against one of the calcium channels in the nerve endings
at neuromuscular junction. (AK Jain 160)
Blood brain barrier is absent in areas called circumventricular organs, e.g Area postrema, posterior
pituitary, osmoreceptor OVLT, subfornical organ (thirst) and pineal glands. (AK Jain 394-395)
Sarcotubular system are a highly specialized system of internal conduction of depolarization
within muscle fiber. It is made of T tubule or transverse tubule and Longitudnal sarcoplasmic
reticulum. (AK Jain 164)
Type IV afferent does not exist. Type I afferent is from nuclear bag fiber. Type II innervate nuclear
chain fiber and have flower spray ending. They control the slow dynamic and static response of
stretch reflex respectively. Alpha motor neuron is the final common pathway to extrafusal fibre for
stretch reflex. Gamma motor neuron is motor supply to intrafusal fibre. (Ganong 13)
Swallowing reflex is a brain stem reflex controlled via vagus nerve. (AK Jain 213,214)
Via α1 receptors localized (adrenergic) sweating occurs. Generalised (cholinergic) sweating
occurs to manifest parasympathetic effect of the sweat gland. (AK Jain 955)
Corticospinal tract arise from the motor cortex in the precentral gyrus. The lateral corticospinal
tract controls lateral or distal muscles or fine manibulatory movement and medial or anterior
corticospinal tract control posture equilibrium and tone (memorise as PET). (AK Jain 936)

Voluntary control of respiration is via corticospinal tract arising from cortex ending at spinal motor
neurons, innervating respiratory group of neurons. Stimulation of respiratory centre by increased
activity in the motor cortex causes increase in ventilation during exercise. Corticohypothalamic
pathway ending on medullary group of neurons mediate and modify voluntary control of respi ra­

produce Pakinsonism. (AK Jain 1028)
The archicerebellum is the first part to develop during evolution and is represented by
flocculonodular lobe. It is functionally linked to vestibulocerebellum. It is concerned with posture,
equilibrium and tone. The paleocerebellum evolved next and is represented by anterior lobe and
parts of posterior lobe, e.g. pyramis and uvula. These represent spinocerebellum and receives
proprioceptive input from lower part of body. Neocerebellum is the newest and comprises
of remaining parts of posterior lobe, i.e. declive, tuber. They receive inputs from pons via
pontocerebellum. (AK Jain 989)
Deep cerebellum nuclei input is negative. The granule cell is always excitatory in the cerebellar
neural circuit. The basket cell, golgi and purkinje cell are inhibitory. (AK Jain 993)
The reticular formation is in the brain stem (pons and medulla). The function of RAS is regulation
of cardiorespiratory function and vomiting as it harbours both centres. Hunger and thirst are
controlled by the hypothalamus. (AK Jain 985)
Thumbs, finger tips occupy maximum area in the somatosensory cortex. Lips are next. Two point
discrimination (or the ability to distinguish between two adjacent stimuli on the skin ) is a cortical
sensation that is tested by a Weber’s compass. The sole of the feet and back are least sensitive
areas. Here the sensory units are large and widely spaced. (AK Jain 912, 921)
Tolerance to pain or inhibition to pain, i.e. Analgesia occurs due to increase in threshold.
(AK Jain 927)
The afferent for segmental stretch reflex is 1a or Aα afferent fibers innervating nuclear bag and
chain fibers of intrafusal origin. (AK Jain 899)
Motor axons give off some collateral branches as they traverse the spinal cord towards the ventral
root, and these collaterals make excitatory synaptic connections with interneurons called Renshaw
cell, situated in the ventromedial part of the ventral horn. These Renshaw cell in turn send axons
which make synaptic connections with the motor neurons. This is an example of feedforward
inhibition. (AK Jain 882)
A fibers are most sensitive to pressure. C fibers are least sensitive. (A K Jain 149)
The cortical representation for control of mictruition is paracentral lobule. In the brain stem
they are two areas: facilitatory area is located in the pontine region and posterior hypothalamus.
Inhibitory area is located in the midbrain. (AK Jain 587)
Smell pathways have no relay in the thalamus and there is no neocortical projection area for
olfaction. The smell receptors are in direct contact with the external environment. The smell
receptors are distant receptors (telereceptors) as well as chemoreceptors. Their adaptation is early
and rapid. (AK Jain 1092)
Duration of action potential in skeletal muscle is 2­4 msec. Nerve fibre duration is 0.4 to 2 msec.
Action potential in cardiac muscle lasts 300 msec. (AK Jain 167)
Corticobulbar fibers end near the motor neurons that innervate muscles of eye, face, tongue and
throat. These fibers are the main source of control for voluntary movement of the muscles of head
and neck. They arise from the motor cortex and control movement of opposite side of the body.
(AK Jain 936)
Axon originates from a somewhat thickened area of the cell body called Axon Hillock. It is here
where propagated action potentials are generated. (AK Jain 140)
Increase in CSF pressure from its normal level initially leads to Bulbar Asphyxia which stimulates
vasomotor centre producing extacerebral vasoconstriction and increases arterial mean BP.
However, marked increases in CSF pressure produces direct depression of vasomotor centre
and compensatory mechanism fails leading to respiratory depression and deterioration of
consciousness. (AK Jain 389)

Blood brain barrier applies to the barrier between blood and the brain tissue. The endothelial
cells are surrounded by a continuous belt of tight junctions that do not permit substances of more
than molecular weight of 2000 to pass. On the other hand, endothelial cells are covered by foot
processes of astrocytes that allow substances with a MW of 40,000. (AK Jain 394-5)
The autonomic nervous system shows some exceptions. In adrenal medulla, preganglionic fibers
directly supply the adrenal medulla, where the postganglionic neurons have lost their axons
and become specialized for secretion directly in the blood stream. It is an endocrine gland not
under the control of automomic system but controlled by the sympathetic preganglionic fibers.
Aldosterone is secreted from the adrenal gland. (AK Jain 948)
Trigeminal nerve innervates muscle of mastication (efferent) and afferent brings sensations from
receptors in skin and skeletal muscles of face, nose and mouth from teeth sockets. (AK Jain 873)
Complete transaction of brain stem below medulla or above the spinal cord, stops all respiration
(apnoea). Apneustic respiration or arrest of respiration in inspiration is seen on sectioning at
the level of mid pons along with removal of vagi. Cheyne’s stoke respiration is a form of periodic
breathing seen during physiological hyperventilation, high altitude, brain damage and left
ventricular failure. (AK Jain 467,482)
Reflexes integrated in the mid brain are righting reflexes. These are a chain of reactions that
maintain normal standing position and keep the head upright. Tonic labyrinthine righting reflex
occurs due to alteration in the position of the head relative to the horizontal plane. Hopping,
placing reaction and optical righting reflexes are integrated at the level of cerebral cortex.
(AK Jain 976-8)
Auditory pathways start from spiral ganglia that innervate hair cells of VIII nerve entering the
medulla and ends in ventral and dorsal cochlear nuclei. These relay second order neurons to
superior olive and trapezoid body. These pass up via lateral nucleus to inferior colliculi, projecting
and relaying to reticular formation, medial geniculate body in thalamus and primary auditory
cortex (Area 41). Superior colliculi serves as a centre for visual reflexes, e.g. light reflex.
(A K Jain 1104-5, 1128)
Fever develops when the thermostat is reset to a new point above 37°C. Interleukin­1 is an
endogenous pyrogen that are produced by endotoxin from bacteria that stimulate monocytes,
macrophages, Kupfer cells. These enter the brain to produce prostaglandins from preoptic area of
hypothalamus producing fever. Aspirin inhibits this synthesis of prostaglandins, decreasing fever.
(AK Jain 596-7)
The receptor of hearing is the organ of corti which is located on the basilar membrane extending
from apex to the base of the cochlea. The receptor is lined by a single row of inner hair cells and
three or four rows of outer hair cells. Inner hair cells are primary sensory cells and are responsible
for fine auditory discrimination. The outer hair cells are responsible for detecting the presence of
sound. (AK Jain 1102-3)
The cells in visual cortex respond to lines and edges in their receptive fields. Complex cells respond
to a linear stimuli of light that is moved laterally. Simple cells of the cortex are responsive to linear
stimuli like bars of light, lines or edges that have only a particular position. Whereas bipolar cells
are cells of the inner nuclear layer of retina (Layer 6). (AK Jain 1154)
The climbing fibers arise from cells in the inferior olivary nucleus. They establish a one to one
connection with the Purkinje cell dendrites and excite to discharge. These are responsible to play
a role in learning important motor skills. (AK Jain 993,994)
Broca’s area is located in inferior frontal gyrus. It processes information received from Wernicke’s
area and projects to motor cortex which initiates movements of the lips, tongue and larynx to
produce speech. Thus, it is the motor speech area. Lesions hear produces nonfluent aphasias

or motor aphasia where there is compromised language output. Speech is slow and words hard
to come by and are limited to 2 or 3 words. They may also be Agraphia or inability to write and
difficulty in articulation without mental confusion. (AK Jain 1066)
The regular alpha rhythm breaks to a desynchronysed low voltage, of irregular waves associated
with a sensory disturbance or alert awake response. Seen when eyes that are closed (alpha) are

The activity of many dendritic units is synchronized by formation of current sinks and sources of
parallel neural processes between the thalamus and cortex. (AK Jain 1014)
The flow of saliva in response to ringing of the bell (conditioned stimulus) is refered to as
conditioned reflex. The introduction of food (unconditioned stimulus) into the mouth sets up a
reflex salivation in a dog called unconditioned stimulus. (AK Jain 1069)
The sympathetic preganglionic fibers leave the spinal cod with ventral roots of spinal cord between
first thoracic and second lumbar segment called thoracolumbar divison. The nerve fibers leaving
the CNS from the brain and sacral portion of spinal cord is via III, VII, IX and X cranial nerves and
second and fourth spinal nerves. Hollow viscera like stomach have dual innervation from both
sympathetic and parasympathetic division: hypogastric plexus. This enables a very fine degree of
control over the effector organ. (AK Jain 946, 951, 953)
Axon reflex is an example of antidromic conduction. Impulses pass normally in one direction only,
i.e. from synaptic junction or receptor along the axon to their termination called Orthodromic

The ability of the eye to focus an object at varying distances is called accommodation. It involves
contraction of ciliary muscle, constriction of pupil and convergence of visual axis. The tension
exerted by the suspensory ligament on the lens is reduced, as a result the elastic lens bulges
forwards and its anterior surface increases. (AK Jain 1139)
Air conducts sound waves to vibrate tympanic membrane. Solid ear ossicles vibrate to transmit
vibration from tympanic membrane to oval window. The scala media is filled with endolymph.
(AK Jain 1099,1102)
In the oral stage of deglutition, contraction of the front pat of the tongue presses the bolus against
the hard palate, while a series of movements of the middle part push it to the back, forcing it past
the anterior pillar of the “fauces” (palatoglossal folds) to the root of the tongue. (AK Jain 214)
Merkel’s disc and Meissner’s corpuscles are concerned with perception of touch. They are rapidly
adapting receptors. This is why we do not feel our clothes once they are put on. Pacinian corpuscles
are concerned with the perception of pressure. They are quickly adapting. This is why we do not
feel seat pressure when sitting. (AK Jain 889,890)
The nerve is refractory or non responsive to a second stimulus, applied in quick succession to an
area immediately behind the area of depolarization. (AK Jain 38)
The dark adaptation consists of two components: fast and slow response. Fast response is due to
dark adaptation of the cones. It occurs over a period of 4­5 minutes. Slow response occurs over a
period of 25 minutes. It involves resynthesis of rhodopsin in rods. Due to this one finds it initially
difficulty to see on entering a dimly lit room. (AK Jain 1149)
Bitter taste is produced by cations. Substances that taste bitter act via G­protein coupled
receptors and phospholipase C to cause release of calcium from endoplasmic reticulum.
(AK Jain 1096, 1097)
Itching like pain originates from stimulation of free nerve endings in the skin and the nerve
pathway: C group of fibers. (AK Jain 930)
Bitter taste is produced by many chemical substances like quinine sulphate, strychnine
hydrochloride, morphine, nicotine, caffeine, urea, phenylthiourea, magnesium sulphate. Bitter
taste is produced by cations. Substances that taste bitter act via G­protein coupled receptors and
phospholipase C to cause release of calcium from endoplasmic reticulum. Bitter taste becomes
unpleasant beyond a small degree and is rejected. (AK Jain 1096, 1097)
Tensor tympani and stapedius muscle get reflexly activated by loud sounds and decreases
the amplitude of sound vibrations of tympanic membrane thus protecting internal ear from
loud sounds. Reaction time is 40 to 160 msec. Therefore a sudden loud sound causes sudden
displacement of hair cells from tectorial membrane resulting in deafness. (AK Jain 1101, 1109)
Primary colors are red, blue and green. Wavelength of orange is 600nm. Thomas Yong Helmoltz
theory states by mixing three primary colours in different proportions, any type of colour sensation
is produced. (AK Jain 1146,1156)
Ruffini end organs are encapsulated expanded endings of A delta and unmyelinated C group of
fibers concerned with perception of warmth and mechanoreceptors. These are found in dermis
and are slowly adapting receptors. (AK Jain 890)
Stapes foot plate is attached to oval window by annular ligament. (AK Jain 1101)

Visual acuity is maximum at the fovea centralis where the cones are closely packed and each has a
connection with a single ganglion cell. The periphery of retina has visual acuity of less than 1/30th
of that of fovea. (AK Jain 1136)
Taste is perceived by taste buds, carried by sensory fibers to Nucleus Tractus of Solitarius. Then
they relay to the posteroventral nucleus of the thalamus. The third order neuron end in inferior
part of posterior central gyrus. (AK Jain 1095)
Tensor tympani and stapedius muscle get reflexly activated by loud sounds and decreases
the amplitude of sound vibrations of tympanic membrane thus protecting internal ear from
loud sounds. Reaction time is 40 to 160 msec. Therefore, a sudden loud sound causes sudden
displacement of hair cells from tectorial membrane resulting in deafness. (AK Jain 1101, 1109)
The crude touch sensations are carried by the ventral spinothalamic tract. The touch is of high
threshold of excitement and is poorly localized. (AK Jain 922)
After removal of the lens, the diopteric power of the eye is reduced by 16 D. Therefore the cornea
is responsible for 43 D of refractive power of the eye. Normal eye has a refractory power of 59 D.
(AK Jain 1136)
Blockage of Canal of Schlemm leads to an increase in intraocular pressure above 80 mm Hg so the
eyeball on palpation feels as hard as stone. This condition is called glaucoma. Normal pressure is
13­18 mm Hg. (AK Jain 1123)
Anterior two thirds are supplied by lingual nerve which branches from chorda tympani nerve,
posterior one third of the tongue run in glossopharyngeal nerve. Taste is perceived by taste buds,
carried by sensory fibers to Nucleus Tractus of Solitarius. Then they relay to the posteroventral
nucleus of the thalamus. The third order neuron end in inferior part of posterior central gyrus.
(AK Jain 1095)
The ear ossicles move as one unit to magnify sound intensity 1.2 to 1.3 times and also helps
increase the pressure in the middle ear by 17 times. This is referred as impedence matching i.e an
effective transfer of sound energy from air to a fluid medium. Due to otosclerosis in the aged the
lever system of ossicles cause high build up of pressure in middle ear of sound and old tympanic
muscles fail to protect the middle ear from high pitched sounds like the violin striking his teeth
(Eustachian tube connects the pharynx area to the middle ear). (AK Jain 1108)
Primary colors are red, blue and green. Thomas Yong Helmoltz theory states by mixing three
primary colours in different proportions, any type of colour sensation is produced. When the three
cones are stimulated equally white colour is produced. (AK Jain 1146,1156)
Pacinian corpuscles are concerned with the perception of pressure. They are quickly adapting.
This is why we do not feel seat pressure when sitting. (AK Jain 889,890)
The anterior hypothalamus is the centre for responses to rising temperature and the posterior
hypothalamus the centre for responses to falling temperature or cold. Shivering is an involuntary
response of skeletal muscles contraction and can increase muscle metabolism up to three times.

Cones in the eye are concerned with ABC: acuity, brightness and colour vision. (AK Jain 1124)
Meissner’s corpuscles are concerned with perception of touch. They are rapidly adapting receptors.

The semicircular canals contain endolymph. The K+ concentration in scala media endolymph is
138 mEq/L. Is composition is similar to ICF, high in K+, low in Na+. (AK Jain 966, 1113)
The semicircular canals contain endolymph. Scala media of internal ear also has endolymph. The

Taste is perceived by taste buds. Taste buds are oval clusters of cells in epithelial layer with a small
opening on the surface that allows substances to reach the interior of the taste bud. (AK Jain 1094)
There are three types of cones, each possessing its own characteristic photosensitive substance.
These receptors subserve colour vision and respond maximally to light at wavelength 430 nm
(blue colour or cyanolabe), 535 nm (green or chlorolabe) and 575 nm (red or erythrolabe).
(AK Jain 1148)
Merkel’s disc and Meissner’s corpuscles are concerned with perception of touch. They are rapidly
adapting receptors. This is why we do not feel our clothes once they are put on. Naked nerve
endings are concerned with the perception of pain and noxious stimulus. They can also convey
sensations of touch and temperature. (AK Jain 889,890)
Progesterone is a thermogenic hormone. Recording the basal body temperature before passing
urine in the morning is an index of time of ovulation. In the pre­ovulatory phase the oral BBT is
36.3 to 36.8 °C which increases by 0.3­0.5 °C after ovulation. (AK Jain 826)
Proprioception means the sense of the body’s position in space and kinesthesia refers to the
sensation with joint movement. The major receptors are joint receptors. These are pacinian
corpuscles, ruffini’s end organs and golgi tendon organs which are situated in ligaments of the
joints. They are quicly adapting recetos and form the endings of afferent nerves of group I fibers
(AK Jain 922,890)
Rhodopsin the pigment for rods is bleached by light. Iodopsin the cone pigment is maximum
sensitive at about 560nm for greenish yellow light. (AK Jain 1147, 1148)
The maximum sensitivity of scotopic vision is approx. 500nm i.e. for bluish green light. This shows
that red colour 650­700 nm is not at all sensitive to dim light. Thus in dim light, if blue and red
colours need to be compared, blue can be made out easily. (AK Jain 1147)
The tops of the hair cells in the organ of corti are held rigid by the reticular lamina and their cilia
are embedded in the tectorial membrane. The hair cells processes bend whenever there is a sharp
motion or stoppage of motion between two stiff structures, the tectorial membrane and reticular
lamina. This results in generation of action potential in the auditory nerve. (AK Jain 1109)
Painful and damaging sounds are at 140dB. The intensity of sound at the maximum of the scale is
actually 10^14 times that required for hearing. Normal conversation is at 60 dB. Zero dB is standard
or reference sound. (AK Jain 1107)
The refractive index or velocity of light in air/velocity of air in that substance is 1.37 in cornea, 1.33
in aqueous humour, 1.34 in vitreous humor and 1.42 for crystalline lens. For practical purposes the
cornea and humors have same refractive index for practical purposes with refraction occurring at
cornea and lens. (AK Jain 1135)
Near point of eye is at that point where the object can be seen clearly, with maximum
accommodation of the lens. It is 25 cm. The near point recedes or moves away slowly as the age
progresses due to loss of elasticity of the lens. (AK Jain 1141)
After removal of the lens the diopteric power of the eye is reduced by 16 D. Therefore the cornea
is responsible for 43 D of refractive power of the eye. Normal eye has a refractory power of 59 D.
(AK Jain 1136)
The eye responds to light of wavelengths between 400 nm and 750 nm called visibility or sensitivity
range of vision. Below 400 nm or ultraviolet gets absorbed by choroids. Above 450 nm or infrared
get absorbed by cornea. (AK Jain 1146)
Human ear can perceive pitch of sound between 16­20,000 cycles per sec or Hertz. It is maximally
sensitive to pitch variations in the 1000­3000 Hz range. (AK Jain 1107)

respectively. (AK Jain 970)
Dark adaptation causes mydriasis or dilatation of pupils, change over of photoreceptor function
from cones to rods, resynthesis of rhodopsin (from retinene, which is formed from Vitamn A1).
Conversion of retinene into lumirhodopsin occurs in the light as the rods are bleached (turned

Korotkoff’s sound is due to arterial turbulence. It is described as tapping, banging, muffling and
disappearance. (AK Jain 363)
Opening of valves is a slowly developing process and does not produce any noise. When the
pressure in the LV exceed the pressure in the aorta (80 mm Hg) and the pressure in the pulmonary
artery (10 to 12 mmHg), opening of semilunar occur. (AK Jain 298)
Essential or primary hypertension is defined as arterial BP >150/90 mm Hg. Cardiac output (SV,
HR) and viscosity of the blood is normal, increased PR due to sympathetic overactivity or influence
of Angiotensin, catecholamines cause increase in cardiac work. (AK Jain 416)
In left ventricular hypertrophy abnormal left axis deviation (LAD) of mean QRS vector left of –30
occurs. In right ventricular hypertrophy RAD right of + 110° is present. (AK Jain 310)
Abnormal axis deviation is caused by bundle branch bloc, ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial
infarction. (AK Jain 310)
In advancing age due to loss in elasticity of blood vessels, stretching decreases which results in
increased pressure during systole with normal diastolic blood pressure. (Systolic hypertension)
The blood vessels behave like a rigid tube. It is characterized by high pulse pressure. Pulse pressure
is determined by elasticity of vessel wall that varies inversely with total peripheral resistance.
(AK Jain 363)
Sympathetic stimulation (T1­T5) increases heart rate (chronotropic action), increases speed
and force of myocardium contraction (ionotropic), increases conductivity in conducting tissue
(positive chronotropic) and increases excitability of heart (positive bathmotropic). (AK Jain 338)
Parasympathetic supply decrease rate of impulse generation by SAN causing heart rate to decrease
(negative chronotropic). (AK Jain 340)
Due to pressure on carotid sinus produced by tight collar, marked bradycadia and hypotension is
produced. (AK Jain 413)
There is no valve at junction of superior vena cava (SVC) and right atrium (RA) therefore right atrial
pressure changes are transmitted to the jugular vein in the neck.
“a” wave is due to atrial systole. Some blood regurgitates into the great veins when atria contracts,
even though the orifices of IVC and SVC are constricted. In addition veins inflow stops, causing rise
in venous pressure, contributing to the “a” wave. (AK Jain 301)

Cardiac cycle normal duration is 0.8 sec at heart rate of 75/min. Ventricular systole 0.3 sec,
ventricular diastole 0.5 sec, atrial systole 0.1 sec and atrial diastole 0.7 sec. (AK Jain 297)
Myocardial hypoxia causes formation of adenosine, a vasodilator metabolite that increases
coronary blood flow (phenomenon called reactive hyperemia). (AK Jain 383)
Veins are capacitance vessels, which simply change their luminal shape to accommodate large
volume of blood without much increase in transmural pressure. (AK Jain 326)
The third heart sounds (HS 3 ) is due to vibrations of cardiac walls produced by rapid filling
phase of the ventricles during ventricular diastole proper. It has low intensity and is 0.1 sec
duration. (AK Jain 301)
Reduction of sympathetic constrictor tone occurs in condition of flushed skin of stress,

SAN is called the cardiac pacemaker and its rate of discharge normally determines the rate at
which the heart beats. (AK Jain 294)
During protodiastole the arterial pressure exceeds that in the ventricles and results in sharp closure
of semilunar valves causing sharp (HS 2 ) or dicrotic notch. (AK Jain 300)
Cardiac muscle is refractory, i.e nonresponsive to restimulation during most part of action
potential. Normal refractory period (ARP) is 180­200msec and relative refractory period (RRP) is
upto 50 msec (AK Jain 180)
Law of Laplace states that the distending pressure (P) in a distensible hollow object is equal to the
tension in the wall (T) divided by the radius of curvature (R). P=2T/R (AK Jain 332)
Skin and skeletal muscles blood vessels represents by far the most important site of peripheral
resistance and offer maximum respiration to blood flow. (AK Jain 325)
Turbulent blood flow is given by Reynold’s number (Re)= Vρd/n where V is velocity of flow in
cm/sec, ρ density of density of blood equal to 1, d is the diameter of blood vessel, n is viscosity
of blood in poise. Turbulence develops when Re exceeds 2000. Viscosity is directly proportional
to haematocrit, i.e. packed cell volume, concentration of plasma protein, diameter of vessel wall
because of plasma skimming. Viscosity decreases when vessel wall diameter falls below 300 μm
due to secretion of mucpolysaccharide. Re > 3000 turbulence is present, <2000 no turbulence is
present. (AK Jain 331)
Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic pressure (50 mm Hg). Pressure falls
very slightly in large and medium sized arteries but rapidly in small arteries and arteroles. The
pulse pressure decline rapidly to 5 mm at the end of arterioles. (Ganong 22nd edition 587)
Colloidal osmotic pressure due to plasma colloids is called oncotic pressure. (AK Jain 15)
Sympathetic vasodilator nerve dilate the arterioles only. Therefore during exercise vascular
peripheral resistance of muscle blood vessels decrease allowing more blood supply. (AK Jain 400)
Dye is injected into vein, it passes though the heart, then pulmonary circulation and finally will be
evenly distributed in blood stream. Hence sample is taken from peripheral artery. (AK Jain 301)
Sinusoids are discontinuous capillaries, possess a thin endothelial layer with large gaps between
individual cells. Therefore, allow easy exchange of large protein molecules. Bone marrow, liver and
spleen are the sites. (AK Jain 326)
J receptors are sensitive to the content of interstitial fluid between the capillary endothelium and
alveolar epithelium. They respond to pulmonary congestion, pulmonary embolisation, pulmonary
oedema and inhaling of strong irritants/chemicals. Tachypnoea is rapid shallow respiration.
J receptors have a physiological role in severe exercise, cause an increase in interstitial fluid in
the lungs. J receptors get stimulated, inhibiting spinal stretch reflex and thus limit the power of
contraction of skeletal muscle. (AK Jain 471)
CO poisoning is a form of anemic hypoxia, as carboxyhemoglobin is formed preventing hemoglobin
to combine with oxygen. (AK Jain 487)
The most common form of hypoxia is hypoxic hypoxia. At tissue level, the oxygen utilization is 5ml
% in normal as well as hpoxic hypoxia (high altitude). (AK Jain 486)
Haemoglobin has 250 times affinities for CO. (AK Jain 57)
Carbon monoxide reacts with hemoglobin in the form of carboxyhemoglobin. (AK Jain 57)
Administration of oxygen gas mixtures is of no value in histotoxic hypoxia. Histotoxic
hypoxia: hypoxia in which the amount of oxygen delivered to the tissue cells is adequate but
because of the action of a toxic agent the tissue cells cannot make use of the oxygen supplied to
them. (AK Jain 489)

(AK Jain 325)
Blood pressure is not reliable in atrial fibrillation. Excitation waves causes irregular contractions.
So BP is also not regular. (AK Jain 315)
Normally renal blood flow is 1.2 to 1.3 L/min, i.e 300­400 ml/100 gm/min. Coronary blood flow is
60 to 80 ml/100 gm/min, Brain 55 ml/100 gm/min, skeletal muscle 3­4 ml/100 gm/min.

After liver (1300 ml) and kidneys (1200 ml) the blood flow is maximum in skeletal muscle
(1000 ml). (AK Jain 325)
Resistance vessels are arterioles. (AK Jain 324)
Blood flow (ml/min) reaching the liver via portal versus hepatic artery is 1200: 300= 4:1.
(AK Jain 245)
Hepatic artery is 1500 ml/min, 300 ml/min from hepatic artery, 1200 ml/min from portal venous
supply. (AK Jain 245)
Heart receives about 5% of cardiac output. Blood flow to the heart = 250 ml/min. Cardiac output
= 5000 ml/min (approx). Therefore % of cardiac output going to heart (250/5000) × 100 = 5%.

PO 2 (mm of Hg) is 40 and PCO 2 is 46. (AK Jain 463)

Explanatory Answers to Endocrinology
75% chromophils exists as Acidophils and Basophils. Acidophils stain red and are of two types:
Somatotrophs secreting growth hormone and mammotrophs secreting prolactin. Basophils are
of three types: gonadotrophs secreting LH and FSH, thyrotrophs secreting TSH and corticotrophs
secreting ACTH, β LPH. (AK Jain 667)
Glucose transport across the following cells does not require insulin:
a. Brain except ventromedial nucleus of hypothalamus
b. Kidney tubules, GIT and RBC’s

Thus brain cannot withstand hypoglycemia. In diabetic patients glucose absorption from Kidney
tubules, GIT and RBC’s remain unaffected. (AK Jain 767)

Secretion of ACTH is mainly under nervous control and corticotrophin releasing hormone control
(CRH). Trauma via reticular formation, emotions via limbic system, diurnal variation from
suprachiasmatic nucleus increase CRH secretion. (AK Jain 731)
Increase in aldosterone or Conn’s syndrome levels leads to rise Na+ levels and fall in K+. The patient
has muscular weakness, hypokalemic nephropathy and metabolic alkalosis that may precipitate
tetany. These are features of Addisons disease. (AK Jain 743)
Calcitonin exerts its calcium lowering activity by inhibiting osteoclastic activity, i.e. bone resorption
and decreases renal formation of 1,25 DHCC. (AK Jain 719)
Myxoedema is characterized by swelling of skin and subcutaneous tissue, goiter, i.e enlargement
of thyroid gland, puffiness of face with periorbital swelling, coarseness and loss of scalp hair, dry
thickened yellow skin, low ESR. (AK Jain 701)
Hyperthyroidism is characterized by exopthalmos (protrusion of eyeballs), lid retraction, increase
in BMR (upto 100%), heat intolerance, tachycardia. (AK Jain 702, 703)
Parathyroid glands are essential for life, as their removal can cause death from asphyxia, resulting
in spasm of laryngeal muscles, thoracic muscles & diaphragm. PTH increases plasma Ca++ and
decreases plasma phosphate by promoting bone resorption. It increases action of cAMP in bone
and kidney. (AK Jain 716)
Cushing syndrome has centripetal deposition of fat (extremities are thin) – fat metabolism,
diabetes mellitus (hyperglycemia), poor wound healing, polycythemia, increase platelet count,
eosinopenia. (AK Jain 738)
Progesterone is a C21 steroid. The major source is corpus luteum and placenta and minor source
is testes and adrenal cortex. (AK Jain 824)
Epinephrine is three times more potent than NE to produce hyperglycemia as β adrenergic action
predominates. Epinephrine increases glycogenolysis in the liver, skeletal muscle and adipose
tissue. The increased glucose is used in fight, flight and fright reactions, as described by Canon.
(AK Jain 755)
Circulating oestrogens are conjugated in the liver to form water soluble sulphates and glucoronides
which are then excreted. 65% are excreted in the urine, 80% which is excreted as oestrone and
oestriol; and 20% remaining as oestradiol. 10 % excreted in faeces. The fate of remaining 25% is not
known. (AK Jain 822)
FSH is secreted by Gonadotrophs along with LH. Gonadotrophs are basophils, that stain blue or
green with basic dyes. They account for 20% of chromophils (granular secretory cells of anterior
pituitary). (AK Jain 667)

Sertoli cells are glycogen rich nourishing cells that secrete androgen binding protein, inhibin,
MRF. They also secrete an enzyme aromatase that converts androgens to oestrogen. They control
release of mature sperms into lumen of seminiferous tubules. They also provide for the blood
testes barrier. (AK Jain 810, 816, 793, 807,808)
Antidiuretic hormone facilitates water absorption via V 2 receptors in collecting ducts; concentrating
urine. Its absence leads to deficient facultative absorption of water. (AK Jain 681)
Loss of negative feedback from T 3 and T 4 leads to increase TSH on thyroidectomy. TSH increases
on exposure to cold, prolonged anxiety, prolonged excitement. TSH decreases during warmth,
stress, anxiety and excitement. (AK Jain 694)
Increased HCO 3 – reabsorption causes metabolic alkalosis called hypokalemic alkalosis, this
decreases free ionized Ca++ which may precipitate tetany. (AK Jain 741)
Factors that increase GH are substrate deficiency, e.g. Hypoglycemia, Oestrogen, Increased amino
acid levels (infusion of arginine), Glucagon, stress, deprivation of REM sleep, Dopamine and its
agonists. GH inhibition occurs by GH itself, Glucocorticoids, Glucose, REM sleep, FFA.

Patient with chromaffin secreting tumors of adrenal medulla (phaeocromocytoma) secretes both
epinephrine and nor-epinephrine. The have high level of BP (300/200 MM Hg), increase BMR,
headache, sweating, palpitation. If alpha blocker like phentolamine is given it results in dramatic
fall in blood pressure. This test is also used to diagnose phaechrocmocytoma. (AK Jain 757)
Decrease in aldosterone levels leads to Na+ excretion and K+ retention. The patient has hypotension,
pigmentation of skin, unable to withstand stress. These are features of Addisons disease.
(AK Jain 744)
Smooth endoplasmic reticulum or Agranular ER is the site of synthesis of steroid in adrenal cortex
and the site of detoxifying processes in other cells. The sarcoplasmic reticulum plays an important
role in skeletal muscle and cardiac muscles. (AK Jain 7)
Insulin increases glucose entry into tissues of skeletal muscles, cardiac muscle and smooth muscle,
adipose tissues, WBC, liver, mammary glands, alpha cell of pancreatic of islet. (AK Jain 767)
SIADH or Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH secretion is characterized by water retention, increased
blood volume, decreased aldosterone secretion, hypernaturia and hyponatremia, decreased
urinary excretion of water, increased urine osmolality, shift of water in ICF, water intoxication or
overhydration. (AK Jain 681)
Prolactin inhibiting factor is Dopamine in nature. It is more important than PRH. Prolactin is
regulated by PIH and PRH from hypothalamus. (AK Jain 679)
Increase in number of receptors or affinity occurs in starvation and exercise. This enables glucose
to enter the cells with little or no insulin. (AK Jain 769)
Vasomotor changes are common like flushing of skin of face, neck and upper chest called Hot
flashes, i.e. sensation of warmth. They coincide with LH surge. (AK Jain 825)
Estrogen lowers plasma cholesterol (increase HDL), preventing development of atherosclerosis,
promoting growth of internal and external genitalia. (AK Jain 823)
Steroid hormones and thyroid hormones being lipid soluble can easily enter target cells and
exert their effect by combining to a specific cytoplasmic receptor protein. Hormone receptor
complex bind to DNA at HRE or hormone responsive element promoting synthesis of enzymes.
Most proteins and polypeptide homones cannot cross the lipid cell membrane and bind to cell
membrane receptor. They activate adenyl cyclase increasing cAMP in the cells. (AK Jain 661)
Insulin is a large polypeptide containing 51 aminoacids, containing two chains. It is secreted from
beta cells at rate of 1-2U/hour. It causes synthesis of glycogen by activating glycogen synthetase.
Insulin stimulates lipoprotein lipase and deposition of triglycerides in muscles, adipose tissue and
liver. (AK Jain 762,768,769)

Testosterone produces protein anabolic and growth promoting effect by a) increases synthesis
and deposition of protein in skeletal muscles b) increases libido and has a role in growth spurt c)
causes epiphyses to fuse, stopping linear growth. (AK Jain 814)
Prolactin inhibiting factor ceases to act on transaction of pituitary stalk, as a result prolactin
increases. Other characteristic features of pituitary insufficiency include features secondary to GH,
thyroid and adrenal insufficiency, gonadal hypoplasia and myxoedema. (AK Jain 685)
Choline + acetyl CoA are combined in the presynaptic membrane to form acetylcholine that is
stored in clear vesicles. (AK Jain 159)
NE containing neurons in the brain are located in the locus cerulus & brain stem. NE acts as
inhibitory neurotransmitters in the thalamus, cerebral and cerebellar cortex, as a mood elevator,
secretion of anterior pituitary hormones, regulation of ADH, oxytocin and control of body
temperature. (AK Jain 1079)
Effects of sympathetic ANS system are produced by adrenergic receptor for, e.g alpha 1 receptor
contracts radial muscle of iris to produce dilatation. (AK Jain 72)
GHIH or somatostatin decrease GH secretion. GHIH is released from hypothalamus, nerve
endings in brain, cells of antrum of stomach, and delta cells of pancreatic islets of Langerhans.
It also blocks the synthesis of insulin, glucagons and gastrin, producing a state of hypoglycemia.
Hypothalamic gonadotophin releasing hormone (GnRH) help release FSH, LH (Gonadotrophins)
from anterior pituitary. (AK Jain 669, 803)
Endocrine glands liberate their secretions into the blood stream to be carried to act on distant
organs and tissues. Also, living tissues contain many substances which may be activated in
certain circumstances to exert profound effects in immediate neighborhood. Such substances
which act at the sites of their synthesis and release have been called Local Hormones. Examples
include: acetylcholine, histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), prostaglandins, adenosine
derivatives: AMP, ADP and ATP, plasma polypeptides, e.g. angiotensin, plasma kinins.
(AK Jain 781-785)

Acetylcholine is rapidly removed from its site of action by diffusion and acetylcholinesterase. It is
a local hormone that acts in heart muscle, cilia of heart muscle. (AK Jain 1076, 781)
Adenohypophysis or Anterior pituitary consists of pars distalis (Anterior pituitary), pars tuberalis
(pituitary stalk), pars intermedia (intermediate lobe). Adenohypophysis is influenced by hormones
which come from the hypothalamus via portal vessels (hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal vessels).
The hormones are FSH, ACTH, LH, TSH and GH from Anterior pituitary. Intermediate lobe secrete
melanocyte stimulating hormone. Posterior lobe or Neurohypophysis secrete vasopressin (ADH)
and oxytocin. (AK Jain 665, 666)
Thyroid cells synthesize glycoprotein thyroglobulin, which is stored as colloid in the follicles. T 3
and T4 are bound to TBG by peptide linkages and stored. (AK Jain 687, 690, 692)
Insulin lack causes hyperglycemia, when renal threshold exceeds 180 mg%, glyocosuria occurs,
due to osmotic diuresis, polyuria occurs, water and sodium loss causes dehydration and
increased thirst, polydipsia. Increased glucagon secretion causes hyperglycemia by stimulating
glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. It is a catabolic hormone, a hormone of energy release.
(A K Jain 761, 773)

Hyperthyoidism features include tachycardia, high output cardiac failure, exertional dyspnea
due to excessive beta adrenergic stimulation. Thyrotoxic myopathy, weight loss, creatinuria and
negative nitrogen balance due to protein catabolism secondary to increase in BMR, hypercalciuria
or calcium loss in urine due to mobilization of bone protein leading to osteoporosis.
(AK Jain 705, 696)

Thyroxine causes increased heat production or calorigenic action secondary to stimulation of
oxygen consumption, increasing BMR. Thyroxine decreases serum cholesterol (normal 150-
MCQs in Physiology
MCQs in PHysiology
76
240 mg %) by increasing breakdown of cholesterol in the liver and by increasing excretion of
cholesterol in bile. Thyroxine potentiates the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine and
their action on CNS and CVS can be decreased by sympathectomy or injection of β blocking
agents. (AK Jain 696, 699)
Menopause is the period of life when menstruation naturally ceases. The ovaries become smaller,
the graffian follicles disappear. The changes are due to senile changes in the ovary which no longer
reacts to the stimulatory effect of hormones (especially gonadotrophins). Therefore, the ovaries no
longer secrete 17 β oestradiol. The pituitary gonadotrophins actually increase. (AK Jain 825)
Aldosterone secretion is regulated by hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, circadian rhythm, ANP
(extra renal control mechanism) and intra renal mechanism, e.g. sympathetic nervous system,
hypovolemia, acute hypotension, chronic disorders associated with oedema, e.g. cirrhosis of
liver. (AK Jain 741)
Phytates in diet decreases calcium reabsorption. Excess of inorganic phosphate, oxalate or
phytic acid- convert Ca++ into insoluble unabsorbable form. High protein, acidity in the stomach
increases calcium absorption from GIT. Normal serum calcium is 9-11 mg%. Normal calcium
occurs in two forms: (a) Diffusable: 55%, (b) Ionized Ca++ or free Ca++ in body fluids (4.72 mg%).
It is physiologically active. Its level chiefly depends on Ca++ reabsorption from GIT. 1,25 DHCC
increases serum calcium and phosphate by its action on GIT, bones and kidney. On GIT it acts
on nuclei of intestinal epithelial cells to increase calbindin D that binds calcium to increase its
absorption. (AK Jain 709, 710, 715)
Role of ACTH in secretion of aldosterone is minimal. Injection of large doses of ACTH increases
aldosterone secretion which falls in 1-2 days even with increasing dose of ACTH injection. This is
because of decrease in rennin secretion secondarily to fall in ECF volume. Aldosterone secretion
is regulated by hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, circadian rhythm, ANP (Extra Renal Control
Mechanism) and intra renal mechanism, e.g. sympathetic nervous system, hypvolemia, acute
hypotension, chronic disorders associated with oedema, e.g. cirrhosis of liver. (AK Jain 741)
Renin Angiotensin causes increase in aldosterone secretion from zona glomerulosa of adrenal
cortex. That causes decrease in renal sodium excretion, and increase in blood volume. Increased
arteriolar tone results from action of angiotensin on blood vessels. (AK Jain 742)
Calcium metabolism is mainly dependent on parathormone. PTH gives the human being a
new skeleton by bone remodeling in ten years. The main effects of PTH are hypercalcaemia and
hypophosphataemia. GH and thyroid hormone have a minor role in increasing calcium. Calcitonin
protects against postprandial hypercalemia and has a minor role in protecting the bones of the
mother during pregnancy. (AK Jain 717, 719)
Cerebral blood flow is autoregulated between blood pressures 65 to 140 mm Hg mean BP. This is
chiefly dependennt on PO 2 and PCO 2 values. It is steady in te recumbent position, upright position,
coughing and straining at stools. Evidently epinephrine has a little role to play. (AK Jain 364)
NE acts mainly on α receptors, and on β1 receptors. It has no action on β2 receptors. The
mechanism on α 1 receptors is via release of intracellular calcium. The mechanism of action on α 2
receptors is reduction in cAMP concentrations. G proteins or GTP (Guanosine Tri phosphate) are
membrane bound regulatory proteins having three subunits: α, β and γ. The α subunit modulates
the activity by interacting with adenyl cyclase, interacting with phospholipase C, directly opening
an ion channel. (AK Jain 17,953)
Steroid hormones and thyroid hormones being lipid soluble can easily enter target cells and
exert their effect by combining to a specific cytoplasmic receptor protein. Hormone receptor
complex bind to DNA at HRE or hormone responsive element promoting synthesis of enzymes.

Insulin is a polypeptide of 51 aminoacids. A chain contains 21 amino acids and B chain 30
aminoacids. The insulin from cattle or sheep is liable to evoke formation of antibodies in man which
cause allergic reactions where as pig insulin, which is more closely linked is better tolerated.
(AK Jain 762)

Testosterone major action is spermatogenesis. It is responsible for development of secondary
sexual organs. It produces increase in protein anabolism and growth promoting effect by causing
nitrogen retention in body, calcium sulphate retention. Testosterone stimulates erythropoietin to
cause increase erythropoiesis not haemopoiesis. (AK Jain 814, 815)
Other Circadian rhythms include melatonin secretion, ACTH and glucocorticoid secretion and
bronchial tone. (AK Jain 1036, 426,731,780)
Once diabetic ketoacidosis occurs, there is marked resistance to insulin, due to presence of large
amounts of FFA, which decreases utilization of glucose. (AK Jain 772-773)
Prolactin inhibiting factor is dopamine in nature. It is more important than PRH. It is regulated
by PIH and PRH from hypothalamus. Prolactin inhibiting factor ceases to act on transaction of
pituitary stalk, as a result prolactin increases. Thus d is the best choice. (AK Jain 679)
Gluconeogenesis is the formation of glucose or glycogen from non carbohydrate sources. Glucagon
promotes formation of glucose from lactate, pyruvate, glycerol and amino acids producing slower
but more sustained rise in blood sugar. (AK Jain 761)
The sensitivity of the uterus to oxytocin increases during latter part of pregnancy and is greatest
just before the onset of labour. The concentration of plasma oestrogen increases and that of
progesterone decreases during last few weeks of pregnancy. During the first stage of labour the
amniotic fluid contains PGE1 and PGE2a. (AK Jain 849)
Testosterone is secreted from cholesterol in the Leydig cells of testis. Seminiferous tubules are sites
of spermatogenesis. (AK Jain 814)

5-Hydroxy-tryptamine or serotonin is formed from tryptophan. It gives rise to melatonin or
N-acetyl-5-methoxytyptamine in pineal gland. (AK Jain 779)
Hormonal control of insulin secretion: Thyroid hormone, glucocorticoids, oral contraceptives
(oestrogen and progesterone preparations), in pharmacological doses increases blood glucose,
which by producing β cell exhaustion decrease insulin secretion and also depress glucose induced
insulin secretion. GH directly stimulates β cell to increase insulin secretion. Epinephrine acts
directly on beta cells of the pancreas, which have more α receptors, and decreases cAMP and thus
insulin secretion decreases. (AK Jain 765)

Substance P is a transmitter for afferent neurons that relay sensory information into the CNS and
is thought to be involved in the transmission of nociceptive (pain producing) stimuli. It is found in
high concentrations in the endings of primary afferent neurons (Aδ and C fibers) in the spinal cord,
in nigrostriatal system, in the hypothalamus. (AK Jain 1082)

Type II cells (granular pneumocytes) are thicker and contain numerous lamellar inclusion bodies
which secrete surfactant. The maturation of surfactant occurs is accelerated by glucocorticoids.
Near term the cortisol levels in both fetus and mother goes up. The number of receptors for cortisol

T3 and T4 are iodine containing aminoacids , tyrosine are stored in thyroid follicle bound to
thyroglobulin. Calcitonin is secreted by parafollicular cells or “C cells” which lie between follicular
cells. (AK Jain 688)
Endothelial cells form three similar polypeptides endothelins I, II and III. The Endothelin 1
(ET-1) being the most potent vasoconstrictor agent which acts via ETA receptors. It produces
vasoconstriction in many body tissues. (AK Jain 336)
Hyperthyoidism features include tachycardia, high output cardiac failure, exertional dyspnea
due to excessive beta adrenergic stimulation. Thyrotoxic myopathy, weight loss, creatinuria and
negative nitrogen balance due to protein catabolism secondary to increase in BMR, hypercalciuria
or calcium loss in urine due to mobilization of bone protein leading to osteoporosis.
(AK Jain 705, 696) n )
Prolactin inhibiting factor ceases to act on transaction of pituitary stalk or blockage of hypo -
thala mic hypophyseal venous portal system, as a result prolactin increases. Other characteristic
features of pituitary insufficiency include features secondary to GH, thyroid and adrenal insuf-
ficiency, gonadal hypoplasia and myxoedema. (AK Jain 685)
Menopause is the period of life when menstruation naturally ceases. The ovaries become smaller,
the graffian follicles disappear. The changes are due to senile changes in the ovary which no longer
reacts to the stimulatory effect of hormones (especially gonadotrophins). Therefore, the ovaries no
longer secrete 17 β oestradiol. The pituitary gonadotrophins FSH, LH actually increase.
(AK Jain 825)
Increased arteriolar tone results from action of angiotensin on blood vessels. (AK Jain 742)
Receptors for endorphins are sites of action of opiate drugs morphine and codeine. They are
present in substantia gelatinosa that conveys information of pain. There are of three types beta-
endorphins, dynorphins and enkephalins. Beta endorphins act by increasing K+ permeability
hyperpolarizing neurons in CNS and primary afferents. (AK Jain 929,1081)
Tyrosine forms dopamine that forms norepinephrine which gives rise to epinephrine in the
adrenal medulla. 5 Hydroxy tryptamine or serotonin is formed from tryptophan. It gives rise to
melatonin or N-acetyl-5-methoxytyptamine. (AK Jain 749,779)
The foetus and the placenta interact as a functional unit, called fetoplacental unit in the formation
of oestrogen and progesterone. Oestriol, the predominant oestrogen of pregnancy, originates from
the fetal adrenal cortex, which forms DHEA. Therefore, the urinary oestriol excretion of the mother
can be monitored as an index of the state of the fetus development. (AK Jain 845)
Progesterone is a thermogenic hormone. Recording the basal body temperature before passing
urine in the morning is an index of time of ovulation. In the pre-ovulatory phase the oral BBT is
36.3 to 36.8 °C which increases by 0.3-0.5 °C after ovulation. (AK Jain 826)
Decrease in aldosterone levels leads to Na+ excretion and K+ retention. The patient has hypotension
and fall in blood volume. (AK Jain 744)
Thyroid follicles is made up of multiple acini or follicles, 50-500 μm in diameter. Thyroid cells
synthesize thyroid hormones by iodide trapping, coupling and storage. (AK Jain 687)
Calcitonin is secreted by parafollicular cells or “C cells” which lie between follicular cells
(AK Jain 688)

Calcitonin exerts its calcium lowering activity by inhibiting osteoclastic activity, i.e bone resorption
and decreases renal formation of 1,25 DHCC. (AK Jain 719)

Pituitary is called the master gland of the body. Anterior pituitary secrete hormones FSH, ACTH,
LH, TSH and GH (FALTS pneumonic). Intermediate lobe secrete melanocyte stimulating hormone.
Posterior lobe or Neurohypophysis secrete vasopressin (ADH) and oxytocin. (AK Jain 665, 666)
Na+ and Cl– is extruded out of thick ascending limb helps operate the counter current multiplier. In
excretion of dilute urine requires normal function of the loop of Henle (especially the tic acending
limb), distal tubule, adequate delivery of fluid to these regions, absence of ADH, reduced medullary
interstitium. (Ganong 721)
Emotions lie anger, anxiety, apprehension, fear, fatigue, frustration act via limbic system
(Amygdaloid nucleus) to reach hypothalamus and increases ACTH secretion from anterior
pituitary to increase glucocorticoid secretion. Aldosterone secretion is regulated by intra renal
mechanism, e.g. sympathetic nervous system, e.g anxiety. (AK Jain 733, 741)
Calcitonin is secreted by parafollicular cells or “C cells” which lie between follicular cells of thyroid
gland. (AK Jain 688)
Hypoglycemia occurs when blood glucose falls less than 60 mg%. Te causes are due to insulin
overdose, or overdose of oral hypoglycemic agents, beta islet cell adenoma or hyperplasia, severe
exercise in diabetic mellitus patients. (AK Jain 774)
During each cycle, of approx. a month time, some 10-15 follicles enlarge to become secondary
follicles under the influence of FSH from the anterior pituitary. (AK Jain 826-829)
Blood brain barrier applies to the barrier between blood and the brain tissue. The endothelial
cells are surrounded by a continuous belt of tight junctions that do not permit substances of more
than molecular weight of 2000 to pass. Glucose is the major source of energy for neurons. It is
transported across the walls of brain capillaries via glucose transporter –GLUT 1.
(AK Jain 394-395)
Vitamin D acts on GIT: intestinal epithelial cells nuclei to increase synthesis of calbindin D that
binds calcium to increase its absorption. (AK Jain 715 )
Glucose transport across the following cells does not require insulin:
a. Brain except ventromedial nucleus of hypothalamus
b. Kidney tubules, GIT and RBC’s

Thus brain cannot withstand hypoglycemia. In diabetic patients glucose absorption from kidney
tubules, GIT and RBC’s remain unaffected. (AK Jain 767)

Calcitonin exerts its calcium lowering activity by inhibiting osteoclastic activity, i.e. bone
resorption and decreases renal formation of 1,25 DHCC. Calcitonin protects against postprandial
hypercalemia and has a minor role in protecting the bones of the mother during pregnancy.
(AK Jain 719)
Testosterone is secreted from cholesterol in the Leydig cells of testis. Seminiferous tubules are sites
of spermatogenesis. (AK Jain 814)
Cerebral oxygen consumption is 3.3 ml/100 gm/min or 45 ml/min, i.e. 20% of whole body at rest.
This is fairly constant and is not affected by thyroxine. Cerebral blood flow is regulated at arterial
pressure of 65-140 mmHg. Noradrenergic discharge helps to regulate pressure between 65-200
mm Hg (plateau phase is extended to right). Vasodilator hydralazine and ACE inhibitor captopril
reduce the length of the plateau. (Ganong 610)
Oestriol, the predominant oestrogen of pregnancy, originates from the fetal adrenal cortex, which
forms DHEA. Therefore, the urinary oestriol excretion of the mother can be monitored as an index
of the state of the fetus development. (AK Jain 845)
Glucocorticoid prevents peripheral utilization of glucose by inhibiting phosphorylation and
exerting anti-insulin action on peripheral tissues. This increases blood glucose. (AK Jain 734)

Luteinizing hormone (LH) or interstitial cell stimulating hormone (ICSH) stimulates ovulation
and luteinizaton of ovarian follicles in female and testosterone secretion in male. (AK Jain 803)
Glucocorticoid produces lymphopenia due to decrease in lymphocyte mitotic activity by
interfering with DNA synthesis and increased lymphocyte destruction in the circulation (directly),
thus increased uric acid excretion in the urine. (AK Jain 735)
The patient has hypotension, pigmentation of skin, unable to withstand stress. These are features
of Addisons disease. (AK Jain 744)
One of the mechanisms by which chemical messengers in ECF bring changes in cell function are by
activating phospholipase C that forms inositol phosphate (IP3) which diffuses to the endoplasmic
reticulum, where it triggers the release of calcium into the cell to produce physiological effects.
(AK Jain 20,21)
No single hormone has been implicated in the control of renal magnesium reabsorption. In
experimental studies, a number of hormones have been shown to alter magnesium transport
in the Thick ascending Limb. These include PTH, calcitonin, glucagon, arginine vasopressin
(AVP), and the beta-adrenergic agonists, all of which are coupled to adenylate cyclase in the TAL.
Minerelacorticoid increase Magnesium concentration. Increase magnesim causes decrease in
PTH secretion.
Theca interna cells of graffian follicles secrete oestrogens. These cells have many LH receptors. The
other sources are placenta, adrenal cortex, testis and placenta. (AK Jain 822)
FSH is secreted by gonadotrophs of anterior pituitary along with LH. (AK Jain 667)
Thyroxine causes increased heat production or calorigenic action secondary to stimulation of
oxygen consumption, increasing BMR. Thyroxine levels are index of metabolic state.
(AK Jain 696, 699)
FSH controls spermatogenesis by its direct stimulating action on te seminiferous tubules. It is
necessary for the maintenance of an optimal level of spermatogenic activity. At any given moment
some areas of semiferous epithelium are active while others are at rest. (AK Jain 810, 815)
Prolactin inhibiting factor is dopamine in nature. It is more important than PRH. It is regulated by
PIH and PRH from hypothalamus. (AK Jain 679)
Insulin causes synthesis of glycogen by activating glycogen synthetase. Insulin stimulates
lipoprotein lipase and deposition of triglycerides in muscles, adipose tissue and liver and glycolysis
for utilization of glucose in peripheral cells. (AK Jain 762,768,769)
Reverse T 3 is 3,3 1 , 5 1 T 3. It is an inactive form of tri iodo thyronine or 3,5,3 1 T 3 , formed by the oxidative
condensation of DIT +MIT. (AK Jain 690)
Most proteins and polypeptide homones cannot cross the lipid cell membrane and bind to
cell membrane receptor. They activate adenyl cyclase increasing cAMP in the cells. However,
epinephrine acts directly on beta cells of the pancreas, which have more α receptors, and decreases
cAMP and thus insulin secretion decreases. (AK Jain 661, 765)
Progesterone is a thermogenic hormone that is secreted in the luteal phase that lasts for a fixed
period of fourteen days. Recording the basal body temperature before passing urine in the morning
is an index of time of ovulation. In the pre-ovulatory phase the oral BBT is 36.3 to 36.8 °C which
increases by 0.3-0.5 °C after ovulation. (AK Jain 826)
Role of ACTH in secretion of aldosterone is minimal. Injection of large doses of ACTH increases
aldosterone secretion which falls in 1-2 days even with increasing dose of ACTH injection. This
is because of decrease in rennin secretion secondarily to fall in ECF volume. ACTH acts to help
convert cholesterol acetate to pregnenolone. ACTH helps to increase synthesis of glucocorticoids
in zona fasciculata. (AK Jain 741)

ADH is a hypothalamic hormone synthesized in the cells of the supraoptic nucleus which are
called magnocellua neurosecretory neuron in response to hyperosmolarity. (AK Jain 679, 680)
Cushings syndrome or hypercortisolism shows features of centripetal distribution of fat, poor
wound healing (protein metabolism), moon facies, buffalo hump, purple striae.
(AK Jain 737, 738)
Thyroxine has a negative feedback mechanism to decrease TSH secretion from pituitary.
(AK Jain 694)
ACTH secretion is minimum between 6 to 9 p.m. in the evening and is maximum between 6-9 a.m
in the morning. (AK Jain 732)
Characteristic features of pituitary insufficiency include features secondary to GH, thyroid and
adrenal insufficiency, gonadal hypoplasia and myxoedema and increased sensitivity to insulin.
(AK Jain 685)
Oestrogen prevents osteoporosis by inhibiting effects of cytokines (IL-1 and IL-6) on osteoclasts.
In postmenopausal women decreased oestrogen concentration leads to increased sensitivity of
bone to PTH. Osteoporosis is a condition which leads to decrease in all constituents of bone, which
leads to decrease in bone mass with preservation of normal ratio of mineral to matrix. It occurs due
to a relative excess of osteoclastic function. (AK Jain 714)
Insulin secretion is increased by glucose that gets metabolized in the islet cells. (AK Jain 767)
FSH is secreted by gonadotrophs along with LH. Gonadotrophs are basophils, that stain blue or
green with basic dyes. They account for 20% of chromophils (granular secretory cells of anterior
pituitary). (AK Jain 667)
Thyroxine causes increased heat production or calorigenic action secondary to stimulation of
oxygen consumption, increasing BMR. Thyroxine decreases serum cholesterol (normal 150-
240 mg %) by increasing breakdown of cholesterol in the liver and by increasing excretion of
cholesterol in bile. Thyroxine potentiates the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine and their
action on CNS and CVS can be decreased by sympathectomy or injection of β blocking agents.
(AK Jain 696, 699)
Steroid hormones and thyroid hormones being lipid soluble can easily enter target cells and
exert their effect by combining to a specific cytoplasmic receptor protein. Hormone receptor
complex bind to DNA at HRE or hormone responsive element promoting synthesis of enzymes.
Most proteins and polypeptide homones cannot cross the lipid cell membrane and bind to cell
membrane receptor. They activate adenyl cyclase increasing cAMP in the cells. (AK Jain 661)
Progesterone promotes the growth of lobules and alveolar tissue in the breasts. It decreases
the excitability of myometrial cells, it inhibits ovulation by inhibiting release of GnRH from
hypothalamus. Progesterone is a thermogenic hormone. Recording the basal body temperature
before passing urine in the morning is an index of time of ovulation. In the pre-ovulatory phase the
oral BBT is 36.3 to 36.8 °C which increases by 0.3-0.5 °C after ovulation. (AK Jain 824,864, 826)
Twenty day is luteal phase. Progesterone is a thermogenic hormone that is secreted in the luteal
phase that lasts for a fixed period of fourteen days. After ovulation as the corpus luteum forms,
serum progesterone concentration increases. LH and FSH levels fall. (AK Jain 826, 829, 830)
Under the influence of ADH only 10-12% of filtered water is reabsorbed. 75-80% of water
reabsorption occurs in the PCT across osmotic gradient set by active tanspot of solutes.

Explanatory Answers
Glucose, aminoacids and bicarbonate are reabsorbed with Na+ in the early portion of the proximal
tubule. (Ganong 713)
GFR is approximately 125 ml/min. (Ganong 709)
Sympathetic stimulation decreases urine output. ADH decreases urine output. ANP increases
urine output (Naturesis). (Ganong 733,734)
Urea contributes to establishment of the osmotic gradient in medullary pyramids and to the ability
forming a concentrated urine in collecting duct. (Ganong 721)
Curea = (Uurea × V )/Purea = (200 × 1)/5= 40ml/min. (Ganong 709)
GFR is approximately 125 ml/min or 7.5 l/h or 180 l/d. (Ganong 709)
GFR= Kf (PGC –PT) –(ΠGC– ΠT). Kf is the glomerular ultracoefficient, PGC is the hydrostatic pressure in
the glomerular capillaries, PT the hydrostatic pressure in tubule, ΠGC and ΠT the osmotc pressure
in the glomerular capillaries and tubule, respectively. (Ganong 709)
Inulin, a polymer of fructose with a molecular weight of 5,200 is found in dahlia tubers. It is freely
filtered, neither reabsorbed nor secreted in the tubules. (Ganong 709)
The amount of protein in the urine is <100/d that comes from the tubular cells. (Ganong 709)
GFR = Kf (PGC –PT) –(ΠGC – ΠT). Kf is the glomerular ultracoefficient, PGC is the hydrostatic pressure
in the glomerular capillaries, PT the hydrostatic pressure in tubule, ΠGC and ΠT the osmotc pressure
in the glomerular capillaries and tubule, respectively. (Ganong 709)
Renal active transport systems have a maximal rate or transport maximum (Tm) at which it can
transport a particular substance. Urea transport is mediated by urea transporters, primarily by
facilitated diffusion, and not actively. Thus Tm value is zero. (Ganong 712)
Na+ is actively transported out of all parts of the renal tubule except the thin portions of the loop
of Henle by various transport proteins. The Tm value for Na systems is high and it is difficult to
saturate them. (Ganong 713)
Urine concentrations are as follows : Uric acid 5mmol/d, Urea 410 mmol/d, Creatinine 12 mmol/d,
Cl– 150 mg/d. (Ganong 713)
In the collecting duct is a Na+ channel (ENaC) that uptakes Na. In the distal tubule NaCl
cotransporters exists and in the TAL Na+, 2Cl–, K+ cotransporter along with Na+/H+ exchanger.
(Ganong 714)
The first urge to void is felt at volume of 150 ml and a marked sense of fullness at about 400 ml.
(Ganong 731)
Inulin is used to measure GFR and PAH renal plasma flow. Filtration fraction = GFR/PAH and is
normally 0.16­0.20. (Ganong 711)
Normal amount of protein in the urine is less than 100mg/d and most is not filtered but comes
from tubular cells. (Ganong 710)
GFR changes linearly with changes in renal blood flow (directly propotional) (Ganong 710)
Inulin is freely filtered and neither absorbed nor secreted in the tubules. (Ganong 709)
Juxtamedullary nephrons have longer loops and thin ascending limbs. They are involved in
countercurrent mechanism and concentrate urine. (Ganong 721)
The thin descending limb is permeable to water but not to NaCl. The thin ascending limb is
relatively impermeable to water but permeable to Na+ and Cl–. (Ganong 721)

Renin secretion is increased by decrease in Na+ in DCT, decrease afferent arteriolar pressure,
angiotensin II, and vasopressin. It is stimulated by increased sympathetic activity, increased
circulating catecholamines, prostaglandins. (Ganong 462)
Clearance of creatinine can be used to determine GFR, as only some creatinine is secreted by
tubules, and is a worthwhile index of renal function. (Ganong 709)
Potassium is removed from the tubular fluid by active reabsorption in the proximal tubules. (Table
38.5). (Ganong 713,727)
Clearance is defined as the volume of substance that is cleared of the substance by the kidney.
Glucose clearance is less than inulin which is less than creatinine which is less than PAH.
(Ganong 709)
Urinary sediment containing hyaline casts shows destruction of glomeruli or tubular cells.
Presence of granular casts, RBC, bacteria, glucose, albumin and ketone bodies is abnormal.
(AK Jain 580)
Creatine clearance is 80­110 ml/min. Determination of 24 hour endogenous creatinine clearance
is an approximate estimate of GFR (180L/d). (AK Jain 548)
Sodium is actively transported out of all parts of the renal tubule except thin portions of loop of
Henle. (Ganong 713)
Urea contributes to the establishment of the osmotic gradient in the medullary pyramids and to
the ability to form a concentrated urine in collecting ducts. Na+ and Cl– out of thick ascending limb
helps operate the counter current multiplier. (Ganong 721)
Glomerular cappilary forms 3­6 capillary loops in six lobules, i.e. 20­40 loops in all. Endothelium of
glomerular capillaries is fenestrated with pores of 100 nm in diameter. (Ganong 726)
Normally 96% to well over 99% of filtered Na+ is reabsorbed. (Ganong 726)
Urine contains no glucose normally. Glucose appears in urine when concentration exceeds
180mg/dl. (Ganong 714)
Fifteen percent of humans have juxtamedullar nephrons in long loops that extend down in the
medullary pyramids. (Ganong 703)
Length in mm of: PCT = 15, Loop of Henle = 14­26, DCT = 5 , CD = 20. (AK Jain 515)
They are approximately 1 to 1.3 million nephrons in each kidney. Total length of nephron ranges
from 45 to 65 mm. (AK Jain 515)
Total surface area of renal capillaries is equal to the total surface area of the tubules=12m^2. The
volume of blood in the renal capillaries at any given time is 30­40 ml. (AK Jain 524)
Under basal conditions renal blood flow is (300­400ml/100g min) or 1.2 to 1. L/min. It is very high
as compared to flow through other body organs. (AK Jain 525)
ERPF = (UPAHV)/PPAH is measured by clearance of PAH and averages 625 ml/min.
(Ganong 707)
(A­V) O^2 difference in kidney is 1.5 ml% is low. Venous blood has high pO 2 and is 80­85% saturated
with oxygen. (AK Jain 525)
O^2 consumption of kidney is about 18­20 ml/min or (6 ml/100 gm/min) which represents 8% of
VO 2 of whole body at rest. (AK Jain 525)
In primates, including humans, some creatine is secreted by tubules and some may be reabsorbed.
In addition, plasma creatinine levels are inaccurate at low creatinine levels because the method
for determining creatinine measures small amounts of other plasma constituents. But it is used as
a worthwhile index of renal function. (Ganong 709)
O 2 consumption of kidney is about 18­20 ml/min or 6 ml/100g/min. The cortex has 9 ml/100g/min
and inner medulla 0.4ml/100gm/min is due to oxygen consumption (VO 2 ). High cortical blood
flow is due to the fact that it contains major components of nephron. (AK Jain 525-526)

Inulin is a polymer of fructose with a molecular weight of 5200 found in dahlia tubers used to
measure GFR. (Ganong 709)
It is freely filtered, neither reabsorbed nor secreted in the tubules, a substance suitable for
measuring GFR, should be non toxic and not metabolized by body. (Ganong 709)
Ureteric obstruction increases the hydrostatic pressure in Bowman’s capsule, along with edema of
kidney inside tight renal capsule. (Table 38.4, Ganong 711)
Factors affecting GFR are changes in renal blood flow, changes in glomerular capillary hydrostatic
pressure, changes in hydrostatic pressure in Bowman’s capsule, changes in concentration of
plasma protein, changes in Kf. (Table 38.4, Ganong 711)
Sodium filtered per minute is 26,000 per 24 hours or 18125 micoequivalents per minute.
(Ganong 713)
Ethanol inhibits vasopressin secretion that explain diuretic action after alcohol. (Ganong 728)
When GFR flow increases , increase in reabsoption of solutes in proximal tubule so that percentage
of tubule solute absorbed is held constant. (Glomerulotubular balance). (Ganong 715-716)
Triamterene (pyrenium) is a potassium sparing diuretic and inhibit the action of spironolactone,
inhibiting Na+/ K+ exchange in collecting duct. Loop diuretics such as furosemide (Lasix),
ethacrynic acid (Edicein) and bumeanide inhibits the Na+ K+ 2 Cl– cotransporter in the medullary
thick ascending limbs of loop of Henle. Metolazone, thiazines such as chlorothiazine (Diuril)
inhibit Na+Cl– cotransporters in the early portion of distal tubules. (Ganong 728, Table 38.11)
Angiotensin II, Aldosterone causes Na+ reabsorption. Vasopressin causes water reabsorption.
(AK Jain 679)
Renin secretion is decreased by increased Na+ and Cl– reabsorption across macula densa.
Increased afferent arteriolar pressure, Angiotensin II, and Vasopressin. (Ganong 462 Table 24.1)
Much of the filtered K+ is removed from tubular fluid by active reabsorption in proximal tubules
and K+ is then secreted into the fluid by distal tubular cells. (Ganong 727)
Glucose, aminoacids and bicarbonate are reabsorbed along with Na+ (cotransport) in the early
portion of the proximal tubule. (Ganong 713)
Urine pH ranges from 4.5 to 8.0 (average 6­6.5), slight acidic, therefore, turns blue litmus red. After
meals it may become alkaline. (AK Jain 724, Ganong 579)
Urea is 20­30 g/d, Uric Acid 0.6 g/d, Creatinne 1.2g/d. (AK Jain 520)
Renin secretion is decreased by increased Na+ and Cl– reabsorption across macula densa.
Increased afferent arteriolar pressure, angiotensin II, and vasopressin (Ganong 462 Table 24.1).
Renin secretion s increased by sympathetic activity via renal nerves, increased circulating
catecholamines, prostaglandins. (Ganong 462)
Creatinine is least absorbable in kidneys. Glucose is actively absorbed and urea passively
reabsorbed. (AK Jain 508)
Angiotensin and aldosterone is stimulated by hyponatremia. They restore Na back to normal
concentration by decreasing excretion. (AK Jain 538)
Clearance is defined as the volume of substance that is cleared of the substance by the kidney.
Inulin is only filtered. A substance that is cleared 20 times faster than inulin would be both
synthesized and secreted by the tubules. Clearance = Filtered + Secreted. (AK Jain 548)
Site of action of ADH is collecting duct. Higher the plasma ADH level, greater would be the
concentration of urine formed and less its volume. Results in the excretion of low volume,
hypertonic urine. Absence of ADH, results in dilute tubular fluid entering the DCT and collecting
tubule. It remains hypotonic and is excreted as high volume, hypotonic urine. (A K Jain 556)

Each kidney has one million nephrons, which are the functional unit. (AK Jain 515)
In renal glycosuria the renal threshold for glucose is low, that is why glucose appears more in urine.
The actual renal threshold is 200 mg% of arterial plasma and 180 mg% of venous plasma (Because
20 mg % gets utilized while passing though the tissues). (AK Jain 536)
Glucose, aminoacids and bicarbonate are reabsorbed along with Na+ (cotransport) in the early
portion of the proximal tubule. (Ganong 713)
ERPF = (UPAHV)/PPAH is measured by clearance of PAH and averages 625 ml/min.
(Ganong 707)
Due to constriction of efferent arteriole, Renal plasma flow reduces, that increases hydrostatic
pressure, that leads to increase in GFR. (AK Jain 533)
The two layers separating blood from the glomerular filtrate in Bowman’s capsule: the capillary
endothelium and specialized epithelium. These are separated by basal lamina. Stellate cells are
located between the basal lamina and endothelium. The glomerular membrane is made of five
layers:
Layer 1: Foot processes of podocytes
Layer 2: Lamina rara externa or outer cement layer
Layer 3: Lamina densa forms the basement membrane
Layer 4: Lamina rara interna
Layer 5: Endothelial cell layer is fenestrated with pores of 100 nm in diameter.
These features allow plasma filtration with retention of plasma proteins and blood cells.
(AK Jain 516, 517)
Urine plasma ratio of creatinine is 150.
Relaxation of Mesangial cells of kidney is brought about by ANP( Atrial natriuretic peptide), cAMP,
Dopamine, PGE2. These increase GFR. Endothelins, PGF2 (prostaglandins), ADH (Vasopressin),
Histamine, Leukotriens C and D, Norepinephrine, Platelet activating factor, Platelet­derived
growth factor, Thromboxane A2 causes contraction of mesangial cells and decreases GFR.
(AK Jain 532,568)
Following cells are responsible for acid secretion in the kidney (T cells) mainly in DCT and
Collecting tubule. (AK Jain 562)
Renin activity in elderly is high. Renin helps regulate BP (i.e increases). For elderly BP is high, so
rennin activity also increases. (AK Jain 523)
Transport Maximum (Tm): Renal transport refers maximal amount of a given solute that can be
transported (reabsorbed or secreted) per minute by renal tubules. Tm for glucose is approximately
75 mg/min in male and 300 mg/min in female. (AK Jain 712)
The sodium content of the filtrate in renal medulla is very high. This is due to the conter current
multiplier operating at the loop of Henle. The descending limb of Henle is impermeable to solute.
The ascending limb of Henle is impermeable to water. By activity of Na+ 2 K+ Cl– cotransporter
some solute enters the medullary interstitium. Also urea absorbed from collecting duct helps
make the medulla hyperosmolar. (AK Jain 555)
Renin helps in conversion of Angiotensinogen to Angiotensin I. (AK Jain 522)
Aminoacids are completely reabsorbed into the proximal convoluted tubule. (AK Jain 530)
Acidification of urine occurs in DCT and Collecting tubule. (AK Jain 562)
The thick ascending limb is relatively impermeable to water but permeable to Na+ and Cl–. The
urine becomes hypotonic here. (Ganong 721)

Glucose, aminoacids and bicarbonate are reabsorbed along with Na+ (cotransport) in the early
portion of the proximal tubule. (Ganong 713)
Na+ and Cl– is extruded out of thick ascending limb helps operate the counter current multiplier.
Urea contributes to the establishment of the osmotic gradient in the medullary pyramids and to
the ability to form a concentrated urine in collecting ducts. The vasarecta forms the countercurrent
exchanger, maintaining this gradient. (Ganong 721)
Glucose is actively reabsorbed, urea passively diffuses from collecting duct to add to the medullary
hyperosmolarity, phenol red is secreted and inulin neither reabsorbed nor secreted. Inulin is thus
used to measure GFR. (AK Jain 510, 529, 520)
Oxygen extraction or A­V difference does not change in kidney despite massive alterations
indicating oxygen consumption varies directly with blood flow. Oxygen consumption of kidney
(VO 2 ) is about 18­20 ml/min (6 ml/100 gm/min) which represents 8% of VO 2 of whole body at
rest (normal: 250 ml/min), second to the heart (8­10 ml/100 gm/min). Blood flow and VO 2 max
within the kidneys is not homogenous because cortical flow is more than that of medulla. High
cortical flow is because cortex contains major part of the nephrons. Low blood flow of the medulla
is because of the high resistance of vasa recta and increase viscosity of blood at the hair pin bend.
(AK Jain 498)
Sertoli cells are large complex glycogen contaning cells that stretch from the basal lamina to the
lumen. The spermatids mature into spermatozoa in deep folds of the cytoplasm of the sertoli cells.
The sertoli cells secrete androgen –binding protein (ABP), inhibin, and MIS. They do not synthesize
andogens, but contain aromatase (CYP19), enzyme responsible for conversion of androgens to
estrogen. ABP functions to maintain a high stable supply of andogen in the tubular fluid. Inhibin
inhibits FSH secretion, causes regression of the mullerian ducts in males during fetal life.
(Ganong 428,430)
The loop of Henle consists of a descending limb which arises in continuity with the terminal part of
the PCT. Descending limb continues into the thin segment where the epithelium is of attenuated
flat cells. From the thin segment arises the thick ascending limb. Loop of Henle actively transports
Na+ and Cl– out of its thin ascending limb. The thin descending limb transports water. Urea
transport is mediated by four urea transportes. (AK Jain 519, 555)
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, e.g. acetozolamide (Diamox) decreases carbonic anhydrase activity,
decreasing intracellular H 2 CO 3 formation, decreasing H+ formation within tubular cells. There other
actions are to decrease H+ secretion, increase K+ secretion and decreasing HCO 3 – reabsorption.
Inhibition of Na+ Cl– cotransport in DCT, e.g. Thiazides (Diuril, Esidrex). Hypokalemia is a major
side effect.

Na­K­2Cl­ cotransport (symport) in the thick ascending limb of loop of Henle, e.g. Furosemide
(Lasix), Ethacrynic acid (Edecrin), Bumetanide (Bumet) are popularly called loop diuretics.
Hypokalemia is a major side effect.

Inhibition of Na+ ­ K+ exchange in collecting ducts by inhibiting aldosterone or Na channels (ENa
C), e.g. Spironolactone (Midamox, Bidiret) is the most commonly used diuretic in clinical practice.
It is a K+ sparing diuretic. They do not produce hypokalemia. (AK Jain 560)

When PAH is infused at low doses 90% of the PAH is removed in a single circulation through the
kidney. (Ganong 707)
Normal voiding pressure is 20 cm of H 2 O, normal volume 1­2.5 l/d average 1.5 l/d. (AK Jain 578)

Explanatory Answers
Glucose is the chief energy source, readily assimilated. Its absorption thus occurs actively
against concentration gradient via sodum dependent glucose transporter (SGLT 1, Na+-glucose
cotransporter) into the intestinal cell and then into the interstitium by simple diffusion or facilitated
diffusion. (Ganong 430)
Peptic ulcer results when an imbalance between mucin and HCl occurs. IgA is protective and is
found in body secretions. Pepsin serves to digest protein in milk, dals, meat. (Ganong 447)
Bile salts and Vitamin B12 are absorbed in the distal ileum, by enterohepatic circulation and
intrinsic factor respectively. Most of the iron is absorbed in the upper intestine. (Ganong 436)
Water absorption primarily occurs in the large intestine. Bile salts and Vitamin B12 are absorbed
in the distal ileum. Emulsification of fat is hampered that results in fatty stools (Steatorrhea). Most
of the iron is absorbed in the upper intestine. Deficiency leads to Anemia. (Ganong 433,436)
Plasma immunoglobulins are synthesized by B lympocytes. Functions of liver are fomation of bile,
metabolism of glucose, inactivation of toxins, providing immunity, synthesize plasma proteins.
(Ganong 455,475)
Cholecystokinin –Pancreozymin is released by fatty acids and aminoacids in duodenum. It inhibits
gastric motility. The other actions along with gastrin stimulates glucagons secretion. Prevents
reflux of food in the stomach, by contracting the pyloric sphincter. (Ganong 454)
The gastric slow wave or basic electric rhythm (BER) is a wave of depolarization that proceeds from
the circular muscle of the fundus of the stomach to the pylorus approximately every 20 seconds.
It plays a major role in gastric emptying (Ganong 449). The contractions of the small intestine are
coordinated by small bowel slow wave. The direction is caudally at 12/min in the jejunum to about
9/min in the ileum. (Ganong 461)
Peristalsis helps move the contents from one part of the small or large intestine to the other like the
squeezing of the toothpaste from the tube. (Ganong 461)
Achalasia cardia is a condition when food acculmulates in the lower esophagus and the organ
becomes massively dilated. The opposite condition is lower esophagal incompetence, which
cannot prevent reflux of stomach contents and results in heartburn and esophagitis. H2 blockers
or omeprazole or fundoplication (making a fold of gastric tissue) can be given. (Ganong 446)
Pancreatic juice has the following enzymes trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, proelastase, pro-
carboxy peptidases. (Ganong 453)
Trypsinogen converts chymotrypsinogen into chymotrypsin that digests proteins. It also activates
phospholipase A2 that forms lysolecithin that damages cell membranes. It’s not possible to operate
on the pancrease (autocatalytic chain reaction). (Ganong 453)
Amino acids leucine, arginine are insulin and glucagons stimulators. Insulin is an anabolic
hormone, building body protein. Protein diet will inhibit insulin release. (Ganong 314)
The sight, smell and thought of food increases gastric secretion. (Cephalic). Food in stomach
increases gastric secretion by mechanical distention. (Gastric). Duodenal chyme inhibits gastric
secretion (Intestinal). (Ganong 450)
Hydrochloric acid is secreted by H+ K+ ATPase in parietal cells. (Ganong 448)
Parasympahetic function increases gastric secretion and motility. Vagotomy however does not
abolish the secretory response to local stimuli. (Ganong 449)

Mucus is secreted by Brunner’s glands in duodenum and by characteristic goblet cells in mucosa
of small and large intestine. (Ganong 460)
Segmentation helps in mixing the food and increase surface for absorption of chyme. Its similar
to the wringing of a towel as ring like contractions appear and disappear at regular intervals.
(Ganong 510)
Contractions of smooth muscle over large confluent areas of the colon are called mass peristalsis.
They move material from one portion of the colon to the other. (Ganong 512)
Myentric plexus or Auerbach’s plexus are between outer longitudinal and middle Circular layers.
Myentric plexus help in peristalsis or movement of chime towards the rectum. (Ganong 512)
The electrical activity is from oral to aboral, even if te individual stands on his Head (Shirshasana).
The activity is basal electrical rhythm, migrating motor Complex. (Ganong 510)
The gastrocolic reflex is presumably a vagal reflex, as food leaves the stomach the cecum relaxes
and the passage of the chyme through ileocaecal valve increases. Gastrocolic reflex is characteristic
when a baby drinks milk and has diarrhea or a man who needs to drink tea in the morning before
the toilet. (Ganong 512)
Fatty acids and aminoacids in duodenum release CCK, which cause gall bladder. Contraction.
(Ganong 502)
Substances increasing secretion of bile are called choleretics, e.g. secretin, bile salts.
(Ganong 502)
Substances that cause contraction of gall bladder are called cholegauges, e.g. CCK.
Percentage of bile solids in hepatc bile is 2-4% and bile salts 10-20% mmol/l as compared to
gallbladder bile 10-12% solids and 50-200 mmol/L bile salts. The production bile is increased by
stimulation of vagus nerves, hormone secretin and bile salts. (Ganong 507)
Acinar cells secreting pancreatic juice resemble salivary glands as it contains zymogen granules.
(Ganong 501)
Acid secretion is increased by secretion by the action of acetylcholine on M 3. Muscarinic receptors,
gastrin, histamine and PGE2. They act to increase activity of H+ K+ ATP ase. (Ganong 497)
Cephalic influences (sight, smell, thought of food) stimulates gastric secretion. These are res pon sible for
one third to one half of the acid secreted in response to a normal meal. (Ganong 498)
Portal venous pressure is about 10 mmHg. Hepatic venous pressure is 5 mm Hg. Mean pressure in
hepatic artery in sinusoids is 90 mm Hg. (Ganong 617)
Parotid gland receives nerve supply from auriculotemporal nerve. Food in mouth causes reflex
secretion of saliva and so does stimulation of vagal afferent Fibers at gastric end of esophagus.
(Ganong 493)
Factors that increase gastric emptying include hunger, happy attitude, light Exercise. Factors
decreasing emptying include depression, pain, violent exercise, Fear, proteins like meat, milk or
lassi.
Gastrin is produced by cells called G cells. Secretin is secreted by S cells of Duodenum.
Enterogastrone inhibits gastrin secretion and motility (Polypeptide YY). (Ganong 489, 490,491)
Pancreatic secretion about 1500 ml/day. It is alkaline and high HCO 3 – content (approx 113 meq/L
versus 24 meq/L plasma). Secretion produces juice rich in HCO 3 – , CCK acts on acinar cells to
produce enzymes. Anions are Cl–, HPO4–, SO4–. (Ganong 496)
Cations in gastric juice are Na+, K+, Mg++, H+, pH (approximately 1.0)
Vitamin D increases calcium and phosphorus in blood. Parathormone is the Major hormone that
causes decrease in calcium and increase in phosphorus in blood. Remodelling of bone by hormone
parathormone results in formation of a new skeleton in seven years! Calcitionin decreases or tone
down the level of calcium and phosphorus. (Ganong 394, Ganong 391)

In metabolic alkalosis the plasma HCO 3 – level and pH rise. HCl extruded from the stomach leads to
alkalosis. (Ganong 739)
Salivary amylase or ptyalin acts at pH 6.0-8.0 to digest starch. It gets deactivated at pH<4.5. Salivary
α amylase hydrolyses 1:4 α linkages, producing α-limit dextrins, maltriose and maltose. Pancreatic
α amylase has a similar action on starch in duodenum. (Ganong 472)
The liver receives about 1000 ml/min, from portal vein and 400 ml/min from hepatic artery.
(Ganong 427)
Oxygen consumption of skeletal muscle is 50 ml/min, brain 46 ml/min, heart 29 ml/min and
kidneys 18ml/min. (Ganong 615t)
Lipase causes triglycerides to form fatty acids plus 1,2 diacylglycerol. (Ganong 472)
Glycogen is synthesized by glycogen synthase. Glycogen is a branched glucose polymer with two
types of glycoside linkages 1:4 α and 1:6 α linkages. (Ganong 292)
Iron in the diet is Fe+++ and absorbed is Fe++. Fe is absorbed in duodenum via transporters
ferroportin 1 and hephaestin 1. (Ganong 481)
The first part of test meal reaches caecum in 4 hours and all undigested portions enter the colon in
8 or 9 hours. The test meal reaches the hepatic flexure in 6 hours, splenic flexure 9 hours and pelvic
colon in 12 hours. From pelvic colon to anus transport is much slower. (Ganong 512)
Saliva contains lingual lipase, salivary amylase, mucins, Ig A, lysosyme, praline rich proteins, Na+,
K+, Cl– and HCO3–. (Ganong 492)
When food leaves the stomach the cecum relaxes and the passage of chime through the ileocaecal
valve increases (gastroileal reflex). This is a vagal reflex. (Ganon 512)
Pernicious anemia is also called Addison’s crisis. Totally gastrecomized patients develop intrinsic
factor deficiency and iron deficiency anemia that must be circumvented by parenteral injection of
cyanocobalamine. (Ganong 500)
Transport of Iron is in Transferrin form. Ferritin is the storage form. Ferritin molecules in lysosomal
membranes are called haemosiderin. Cerruloplasmin transports copper (Wilson’s disease).
(Ganong 482)
90-95% of bile salts are absorbed from the terminal ileum by an extremely efficient Na+-bile salt
cotransporter powered by Na+ K+ ATP ase (Enterohepatic circulation). (Ganong 505)
Food rich in carbohydrate leaves stomach in a few hours. Protein rich food leaves more slowly, and
emptying after a meal containing fat is slowest. (Ganong 499)
Sweet taste is produced due to glucose. Salty due to Na+ ions. Sour taste due to H+ ions. Bitter is a
complex sensation. Strychnine hydrochloride stimulates bitter taste at threshold concentration
of 1.6 μmol/l. Glucose stimulates sweet at 80,000 μmol/l. HCl sour at 100 μmol/l and NaCl salty at
2000 μmol/l. (Ganong 193)

gastric motility, insulin secretion, gastric acid and pepsin secretion. (Ganong 488, 489)
Resection of ileum prevents absorption of bile salts, that leads to deficient fat absorption. Other
complications include hypocalcemia (osteomalacia), arthritis, hyperuricemia and possibly fatty
infiltration of liver, followed by cirrhosis. (Ganong 511)
Albumin is synthesized in the liver. Globulin is synthesized by cells in plasma. Hepatic failure
decreases the level of albumin. A/G ratio decreases. (Ganong 543,504)
One acinus consists of a central vein, portal space containing branches of bile duct, portal vein and
hepatic artery. (Ganong 504)
Total endogenous secretions from salivary glands, stomach, bile, pancreas, intestine is 9000 ml,
8800 ml is reabsorbed in jejunum, ileum and colon. Balance in stool is 200 ml. (Ganong 480)
Swallowing is initiated by the voluntary action of collecting the oral contents on the tongue
and propelling them backward into the pharynx (oral phase). This starts a wave of involuntary
contraction in the pharyngeal muscles pushing the material in esophagus. Inhibition of respiration
and glottic closure occurs (pharyngeal phase). Peristaltic waves push the food into the stomach at
the rate of 4 cm/sec. (esophageal phase). (Ganong 493)
Totally gastrecomized patients develop intrinsic factor deficiency and iron deficiency anemia that
must be circumvented by parenteral injection of cyanocobalamine. Protein digestion is normal in
absence of pepsin. The patient must eat frequently. Weakness, dizziness and sweating after meals
due to hypoglycemia is the picture in “dumping syndrome” where portions of stomach have been
removed. (Ganong 500)
The absorptive capacity of mucosa of large intestine is great. Na+ is actively transported out of the
colon, and water follows along the osmotic gradient thus generated. (Ganong 512)
In normal individuals, bile flows into the gall bladder when sphincter of Oddi is closed. In the
gall bladder, the bile is concentrated by absorption of water. The common bile duct enters the
duodenum papillae. Its orifice is surrounded by the sphincter of Oddi, that unites with the
pancreatic duct before entering the duodenum. (Ganong 503,507)
Secretin increases secretion of bicarbonate by duct cells of pancreas and biliary tract. Its secretion
is increased by production of protein digestion and by acid bathing mucosa of upper small
intestine. (Ganong 490)
Mechanisms that enhance motility are hunger, happy attitude, light exercise like walking,
carbohydrate rich diet. Mechanisms that decrease motility are depression, fear, proteins, milk.

Explanatory Answers
Alveolar ventilation is the amount of air ventilating the alveoli per minute.
Alveolar ventilation = (Tidal volume – Dead space) × Respiratory rate

= (500-150) × 12

= 4200 ml (AK Jain 449)

Respiratory distress syndrome is a serious disease of new born infants, due to deficiency of
surfactant. It develops in infants who are preterm, i.e they are born before their surfactant becomes
functional. (AK Jain 442)
CO 2 enter into capillaries by diffusion. Arterial blood PCO 2 is 40 mmHg. Tissue PCO 2 is 46 mm Hg.
Diffusion occurs from tissue to blood due to difference in PCO 2. (AK Jain 461)
Affinity of carbon monoxide to combine with haemoglobin is 200 times more than that of oxygen.
Higher affinity of CO for haemoglobin produces large proportions of haemoglobin (CO-Hb) and
therefore, haemoglobin is unavailable for oxygen carriage. CO shifts the oxygen dissociation curve
to the left due to inhibition of synthesis of 2,3 DPG. (AK Jain 458, 57)
Work of breathing is 0.3 to 0.8 kgmt/min. Elastic resistance is 65%. Non elastic resistance:
•    Viscous 7 %
•    Airway resistance 28%. Most of the energy is spent in overcoming elastic resistance.
(AK Jain 448)
Chemical stimuli like CO 2 , O 2 and H+ affect respiratory centre. (AK Jain 470)
Average = 100l/min. It is the largest volume of air that can be moved into and out of the lung in one
minute by maximum voluntary effort. (AK Jain 440)
Increase in HCO 3 – concentration occurs in hypoventilation, decrease in HCO 3 – concentration
occurs in hyperventilation. Acidosis (decrease in HCO 3 – and increase in H+ concentration)
increases respiration. Alkalosis (increase in HCO 3 – and decrease in H+ concentration) result in
hypoventilation. These effects are mediated via peripheral chemoreceptor. (AK Jain 498)
In small doses, adrenaline stimulates respiration by stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors. In
high doses, it raises the systemic arterial blood pressure, which inhibits the respiration producing
apnoea, called adrenaline apnoea. (AK Jain 472)

Pulmonary ventilation is the amount of air ventilating the alveoli per minute. Pulmonary
ventilation = (Tidal volume – Dead space) × Respiratory rate. Dead space is the volume of air
in the respiratory passage which does not take part in exchange of gases (wasted pulmonary
ventilation). However, if the patient’s pulmonary ventilation is greater than the respiratory rate,
it means that he is respiring in dead space. Dead space increases in emphysema, bronchiectasis
and pulmonary embolism. It remains constant in rapid shallow respiration and slow and slow and
deep respiration, i.e 150 ml. (AK Jain 424)
In high altitude, decrease arterial pO 2 stimulates peripheral chemoreceptor and increases
pulmonary ventilation, CO 2 wash out, decreasing alveolar PCO 2 that decreases H+ concentration
in blood (alkalosis) and this should inhibit respiration. (AK Jain 497)
The chemical regulatory mechanism adjust ventilation in such a way that the alveolar PCO 2 is kept
constant at normal value of 40 mm Hg. (AK Jain 473)
Tidal volume is 500 ml. Volume of air breathed in or out of lung during quiet breathing.

Inspiratory reserve volume is 2000 to 3200 ml. The maximum volume of air which can be inspired
after completing a normal tidal inspiration, i.e. inspiration from the end inspiratory position.
(AK Jain 435)
Vital capacity is 4.8 L in males and 3.2 L in females. It is the maximal amount of air that can be
expelled from the lungs by forceful effort following a maximum inspiration. (AK Jain 435)
Inspiratory capacity is the maximal volume of air which can be inspired after completing tidal
expiration. Vital capacity is 2500 to 3700 ml. (AK Jain 435 )
CO 2 has high diffusion coefficient of about 20 times more than that of O 2. (AK Jain 461)
Cerebral blood flow is well regulated at arterial pressure of 65 -140mm Hg and shows no change.
Defective gas exchange causes hypoxia that causes marked increase in pulmonary arterial
pressure or pulmonary hypertension, that leads to right atrial hypertrophy (prominent p wave),
right ventricular hypertrophy, right heart failure and pulmonary oedema. Hypoxia also stimulates
erythropoiesis resulting in increased red cell membrane. (Ganong 610)
Apnoea means stoppage of all respiration. (AK Jain 468)
D α Δ P × SA × SOL
Factors that affect rate of diffusion: –-–––––––––––––––––
T × √MW
Where D is the quantity of gas that diffuses through a barrier in given time
MW is molecular weight of substance
SOL is solubility of particle in medium
Δ P is the driving pressure
SA is the surface area
T is the temperature
The molecules of each species diffuse independently. (AK Jain 12,14)
Work of breathing is 0.3 to 0.8 Kgmt/min. Elastic resistance is 65%. Non elastic resistance 1) Viscous
7 % 2) Airway resistance 28%. Most of the energy is sed in overcoming elastic resistance.
(AK Jain 448)
The intrapulmonary pressure decreases due to expansion of lung. At the end of expiratory position,
the tendency of the lung to recoil from the chest wall is just balanced by tendency of chest wall to
move in the opposite direction. This causes slight subatmospheric pressure to develop, i.e.,–2 mm
of Hg between two layers of pleura at start of inspiration. (AK Jain 433)
The sensitivity of CO 2 on respiration decreased by sleep, anesthesia and hypothermia. It is
increased by hypoxia, hyperthermia. (AK Jain 480)
Surfactant decreases surface tension. When lungs are inflated in inspiration it is less effective.
Surfactant decreases due to occlusion of one pulmonary artery. (AK Jain 441, 442)
Stimulation of adreno receptor produces smooth muscle relaxation. Asthma or bronchoconstric-
tion is worsened in the cold. (AK Jain 955 )
Arterial pO 2 decreases it stimulates peripheral chemoreceptors to increase respiration. Hyper-
ventilation increases CO 2 washout, decreasing alveolar pCO 2 and decreases H+ concentration in
blood (alkalosis). This inhibits respiration as a result in acclimatized state ventilation shows no
change. Cerebral blood flow is well regulated at arterial pressure of 65-140 mm Hg and shows no
change. (AK Jain 497, Ganong 610)

Forced vital capacity FVC is the maximum volume of air that can be breathed out as forcefully
and rapidly as possible following a maximum inspiration. FEV 1 or forced expiratory volume in one
second of exhalation is 80% of FVC. FEV2 in two seconds is 95%. FEV 3 in first three seconds of
exhalation is 98-100%. (AK Jain 438)
With the exception of FRC, all other lung volume and capacities can be measured with the help of
simple spirometer. (AK Jain 437)
Surfactant is secreted by granular pneumocyte, i.e. alveolar lining epithelium. Type II cells and
comes to the surface by exocytosis. It is removed by pulmonary alveolar macrophages.
(AK Jain 440)
Functional residual capacity is volume of air which is contained in lungs at end expiratory position.
Normal is 2.5 litres. It acts as a buffer allowing continuous exchange of gases to occur even during
expiration thereby prevents sudden hanges in partial pressure of gases in blood. (AK Jain 437)
Substance synthesized or stored and released into blood are: Prostaglandin, Histamine, Kallikrien.
(AK Jain 430)
Alveolar ventilation = (Tidal volume – Dead space) × Respiratory rate
= (500 –150) × 12

= 4200 ml (AK Jain 449)

Peak expiratory flow rate is the maximum flow of air achieved during measurement of forced vital
capacity. It is an index of mid sized airway function. Maximum mid expiratory flow rate (MMEFR)
is the mean expiratory flow rate during 50% of FVC. Normal is 300L/min. (AK Jain 440,502-503)
Diaphragm is the main muscle of inspiration. The external intercostals muscles supplied by T 1 , T 2.
cause an increase in anterior-posterior diameter of ribs (second to sixth) as they move outwards
in inspiration (Pump handle movement). The lower ribs (7th and 10th) also swing outward and
upwards in inspiration to cause an increase of transverse diameter (Bucket handle movement).
(AK Jain 431)
Cheyne Stokes respiration is a periodic form of breathing that is caused by:
•    Physiological:
Voluntary Hyperventilation
High altitude
During sleep in some normal individuals
• Pathological:
Heart failure
Brain damage
Uremia. (AK Jain 482)
280 L CO 2 produced in 24 hours. 4 ml % is transported in blood. Out of which 0.3 % is in dissolved
form, 0.7 ml% is in carbamino compounds and 3 ml% as bicarbonate. (AK Jain 461)
Physiologic and anatomic dead space is not same in pathological conditions because of closed
capillaries or poorly perfused lungs. It is same in a normal individual. (AK Jain 449-451)
97% is Hb-O 2 saturation, rest is dissolved in plasma. (AK Jain 456)
Renal body fluid volume for regulating arterial pressure is a long term over period of weeks,
months. This includes rennin angiotensin system. Choice A- is the baroreceptor mechanism for
beat to beat regulation every second. (AK Jain 346)
Carbon dioxide washout, HCO 3 – is exchanged with Cl– that moves out of the RBC. This is opposite
to chloride shift in venous blood, where the packed cell volume is more than arterial blood. The
cells are larger because of influx of chloride brings water along. (AK Jain 464)

In anemic hypoxia and carbon monoxide poisoning despite the normal arterial pO 2 decreased
amount of hemoglobin causes decreased tissue oxygen. KCN and are examples of histotoxic
hypoxia. Here again normal arterial pO 2 is there but due to the toxic agent the tissue cannot utilize
oxygen. In pulmonary hypoventilation, however decreased arterial pO 2 is present , normal oxygen
carrying capacity and rate of blood flow to the tissues exist. (AK Jain 490)
High altitude acclimatization changes occur at three levels: lungs, blood, tissues. Ascent to high
altitude triggers a substantial rise in 2,3 DPG concentration in RBC, shifting the oxygen dissociation
curve to right. The systemic capillaries open at tissues. Polycythemia and Hyperventilation does
not occur once the person has acclimatized to the high altitude. (AK Jain 497)
Increase in carbon dioxide> 7% causes CNS depression, reducing ventilation and threshold of
reticular formation. This is called carbon dioxide narcosis. (AK Jain 477)
In sleep the energy rests in the spine, away from the lungs. The breath slows, the body rests.
Stimulants of respiration are adrenaline in exercise to give more oxygen to lungs, H+ ions (decreased
pH). HCO 3 – has no direct role, though its value is important to diagnose conditions of respiratory
acidosis. (AK Jain 472)
The negative intrapleural pressure is directly proportional to amount of thoracic expansion.
Intrapleural pressure is the pressure between the visceral and parietal pleura (the coverings of
the lungs). In inspiration this pressure is negative to the atmosphere, to enable air to move in the
lungs. At the end of deep inspiration it is -6 mm of Hg. -4 mm of Hg is the closest choice.
(AK Jain 430)
Timed vital capacity is the maximum volume of air which can be breathed out as forcefully
and rapidly as possible following a maximum inspiration. Scoliosis is a restrictive disease (also
kyphoscoliosis, ankylosing spondylitis), in which the back is bent sidewards, chest expansion is
resticted. Lungs is like a tank whose opening is the bronchus. In fibrosis also the volume of lung
i.e. its capacity decreases but FEV1 is normal. In obstructive the opening is decreased in size. So
the rate of flow of air (timed vital capacity) through the narrow opening is less in bronchial asthma,
chronic bronchitis, emphysema (Obstructive diseases), i.e. VC is normal but FEV1 decreases.
(AK Jain 438)
Alveolar ventilation = (Tidal volume – Dead space) × Respiratory rate
= (500 –150) × 12
= 4200 ml (AK Jain 449)
Pulmonary capillaries are 4μm in radius and 350 μm long. A network of pulmonary capillaries
surrounds the alveoli and is sandwiched between their walls. At rest: effective surface wall surface
area increases to 60 m^2 and transit time is one second. During heavy exercise area increases to 90
m^2 and transit time to 0.3 seconds. (AK Jain 405)
Air in pleural cavity causes collapse of lung due to equalization of intrapleural pressure with
atmospheric pressure. This decreases the vital capacity and residual volume. Due to air there is
increased resonance on percussion. (AK Jain 435)
A height in excess of 10,000 feet (3000 m) above sea level is defined as high altitude. Hyperpnoea
(increase in breathing) occurs at high altitude when arterial pO 2 falls below 60 mm Hg, resulting in
fall in alveolar pCO 2. (AK Jain 494)
A height in excess of 10,000 feet (3000 m) above sea level is defined as high altitude. Hyperpnoea
(increase in breathing) occurs at high altitude when arterial pO 2 falls below 60 mm Hg, resulting in
fall in alveolar pCO 2. (AK Jain 494)
Administration of 80-100% O 2 for more than 8 hours will stimulate irritant receptors. For more
than 24 hours will cause bronchopneumonia. At “three” atmospheric pressure, inhalation of 100%
causes oxygen toxicity quite early. (AK Jain 492)

Inhalation of 100% oxygen at high barometric pressure is called hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
Inhalation of 100% oxygen at one atmospheric pressure is useful in hypoxic hypoxia. It has limited
value in anaemic, stagnant and histotoxic hypoxia. Nitrogen toxicity causes high pressure nervous
syndrome that is treated by compressing and slowly decompressing to dissolve the nitrogen
bubbles and release it. O 2 – Helim mixture are used instead of nitrogen. (AK Jain 491, 501)
Cheyne Stokes respiration is a periodic form of breathing that is caused by:
•    Physiological:
Voluntary Hyperventilation
High altitude

For every 33 feet (10 meters) deep down in sea there will occur an increase in pressure by one
atmospheric pressure. In fresh water it is for every 10.4 meters. (AK Jain 500)
Carbon dioxide accumulation in venous blood, HCO 3 – removed from the RBC. Cl– moves into the
cell. This is chloride shift. Thus in venous blood, the packed cell volume is more than arterial blood.
The cells are larger because of influx of chloride brings water along. (AK Jain 464)
Alveolar pCO 2 depends upon balance between metabolism of body and respiration. When body
metabolism increases, alveolar pCO 2 increases, CO 2 is washed out, restoring alveolar pCO 2.
Opposite is seen when body metabolism decreases. (AK Jain 494)
Medullary (central) chemoreceptors are located on the ventral surface of medulla near the
respiratory centre. They get stimulated by the H+ concentration of CSF. The magnitude of
stimulation is directly proportional to local increase in H+ concentration, which increases in
linearity with the arterial pCO 2. These chemoreceptor get inhibited by anaesthesia, cyanide and
during sleep. (AK Jain)
Factors affecting respiratory centre:
•    Chemical stimulation: CO 2 , O 2 and H+
•    Non chemical stimuli:
Afferent from higher centre
Vagal afferent from inhalation and deflation receptors in the lungs
Afferent from proprioceptors
Afferent from pharynx, trachea and bronchi
Afferent from baroreceptor
Chemoreceptors (carotid and aortic bodies). (AK Jain 470,471)
A height in excess of 10,000 feet (3000 m) above sea level is defined as high altitude. Hyperpnoea
(increase in breathing) occurs at high altitude when arterial pO 2 falls below 60 mm Hg, resulting in
fall in alveolar pCO 2. (AK Jain 494)
In high altitude, decrease arterial pO 2 stimulates peripheral chemoreceptor and increases
pulmonary ventilation, CO 2 wash out, decreasing alveolar pCO 2 that decreases H+ concentration
in blood (alkalosis) and this should inhibit respiration. (AK Jain 497)
Breath holding occurs for a period of 45-55 seconds in normal healthy subjects. The point at which
breathing can no longer be voluntary inhibited is called breaking point. It is due to increased
arterial pCO 2 and decreased arterial pO 2. (AK Jain 481)

During exercise VO 2 (oxygen consumption) increases 15-20 times from the resting value of 250
ml/min due to increase in cardiac output, increase alveolar ventilation, capillary density and RBC
count. (AK Jain 508)
Strenous exercise is defined as that in which heart rate increases to 150/min and oxygen
consumption is 75% of resting value. In this pulmonary ventilation increases disproportionately
due to anaerobiosis of the working muscles, which contributes an extra drive to working muscles,
which contributes an extra drive to respiratory centre. Even at low pO 2 the tissues can utilize oxygen
as oxygen dissociation curve shifts to the right due to rise in temperature, increase in arterial pCO 2 ,
decrease arterial pO 2 and decrease in arterial pH. (AK Jain 508)
Bronchopulmonary circulation accounts for about 2% of systemic circulation. These supply the
bronchus and lungs. (AK Jain 404, 429)
Substance metabolized are serotonin, prostaglandin, bradykinin, adenine derivative, acetylcholine,
norepinephrine. (AK Jain 430)
Forced vital capacity FVC is the maximum volume of air that can be breathed out as forcefully
and rapidly as possible following a maximum inspiration. FEV 1 or forced Expiratory Volume in
one second of exhalation is 80% of FVC. FEV 2 in two seconds is 95%. FEV 3 in first three seconds of
exhalation is 98-100%. (AK Jain 438)
Tidal volume is 500 ml. Volume of air breathed in or out of lung during quiet breathing.
(AK Jain 435)
Surface area > 70 m^2. (AK Jain 424)
300 million alveoli are there in the two lungs. Surface area > 70 m^2. (AK Jain 424)
Vital capacity in men is 4.8 litre. This maximal volume of air is expelled from the lungs by forceful
effort following a maximal inspiration. (AK Jain 436)
Tidal volume is 500 ml. Volume of air breathed in or out of lung during quiet breathing.
